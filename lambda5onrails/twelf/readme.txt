    Twelf code for Proposal        -      Tom Murphy  31 Jan 2006

These are the sources for the formalization of the content of my
proposal.

 el.elf - The external language 
 il.elf - Internal language with dynamic semantics
 elab.elf - Translation from external language to internal
 cps.elf - CPS language and dynamic semantics

Not yet complete:
 - type polymorphism
 - sums
 - recursive types
 - CPS conversion
  (coming soon; I have done this for a related 
   modal language without the circle type)
 - closure conversion
