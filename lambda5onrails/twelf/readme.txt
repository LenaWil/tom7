 il.elf - Internal language with dynamic semantics
 elab.elf - Translation from external language to internal
 cps.elf - CPS language and dynamic semantics
 tocps.elf - Converts to CPS language
 cc.elf - Very simple closure conversion algorithm (not yet complete)

Not yet complete:

 - sums
 - recursive types
