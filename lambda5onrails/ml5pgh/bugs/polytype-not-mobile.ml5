(* XXX this can be trimmed further.

   the problem is that 's' is polymorphic, below, but we require that
   it be mobile. the mobility check should not fail on unresolved
   tyvars (they should be set to some mobile type, like unit) or else
   the setting of tyvars to unit should just happen before the
   mobility check.

   actually oops: s's tyvar isn't unset here, it's just a valid
   function. we shouldn't generalize: the requirement that s be mobile
   should be considered part of the "outer context" for the purpose of
   generalization.

   (there is a simpler example of this in the dissertation)
