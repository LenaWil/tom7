There are many self-checks (e.g. closure conversion checks that it
produces closed code) that are redundant to type checking and other
later checks. We ought to run these only when a "paranoid" flag is
set.

Computation of the number of free variable occurrences might be wrong?
It looks like we inline records, which we shouldn't do unless there is
only 1 occurrence. We should have a suite of tests for AST.

 Could support "extern mobile type" (easy, just check
 mobility with concrete type at link time); see Dagstuhl
 talk for example.

Cleanup:
  * Use AST for IL (there are probably alpha conversion bugs in current implementation)
  * Get rid of inexhaustive matches
  * Dead code (e.g. IlUtil)
  * Extraneous keywords from old compilers.
  * Labels support "special" labels; not needed.

Features:
  * validity for 'val' decls
    - should come with rewrite of fun to fns, probably, so that it is
      only in one place.

Other performance improvements
  * Could leak less memory with 'say' by marshaling the argument; then we only
    need to put some kinds of things in the desiccation table. Refs could have
    an optional field indicating that they are already in the table?
  * We should really generate more compact representations of sums and products
    by using numbered fields. It is silly to be comparing strings "true" and "false"
    at runtime...
  * direct calls to polymorphic and valid functions!
  * eliminate recursive mu when it is unused ('a option, bool, etc.)
    it costs because we must represent the type, and mu dictionaries are expensive
    (marshal context bindings)
    ... it is nice to see them for debugging, though.
    ... probably this should be done at the IL level?

Bugs
  * nullary 'fun' and 'fn' are wrong; they produce functions of type ('a -> ('b -> 'c)).

Passes to implement:

CPS Optimization
  * Dead doesn't eliminate some dead code that it could eliminate!
    Dead is one of the most important optimizations, so it should be reasonably complete...
  * really should run optimization rounds in a loop.
  * unused argument removal post-undict would be great, but
    the code is pretty messed up at that point...
  * monomorphize code that does not need to be polymorphic or valid;
    cheaper because there are fewer type representations. aggressive
    monomorphization a la mlton might even produce better (and less) code.
  * split up or eliminate friends that are not friends.
    this is tricky only because we don't always have a good place
    to put the split up friends.
  * optimizations specific to this domain: like get-self or get-get
  * "globals" so that we do not need to pass around Match and Sub
    everywhere we go. I think this would be the biggest optimization we could
    make. (But also one of the hardest.)
  * 'known' names subterms and therefore could interfere with later optimizations.
    an inlining phase would undo this.
  * already-bound, prevent recreation of things that are already bound
    (subsumes x = y renaming optimization)
    (this happens frequently with rebuilt environments (?))

Backend optimizations
  * could flatten out lams so that we represent a function as a single integer,
    and fsel as +
  * don't use named records!

BUG: nullary is wrong; we define LESS as nullary and later as exp * exp, and then we can never use LESS.
