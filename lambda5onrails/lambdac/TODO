BUG: nullary is wrong; we define LESS as nullary and later as exp * exp, and then we can never use LESS.


BUG: exhaustiveness warning in bug-exhaust.uml

PERF: (SPLIT) optimization in CPS is hurt by intervening "fix"; ie we can't
      identify

      fn x =>
       let fun f = some crap that doesn't depend on x
       in
          (case x of
            ....)
       end

      as a splitter. this affects our ability to apply the optimization
      in MANY examples I look at, including the simplest (if x = 3) 
      kind of stuff. Try first hoisting functions out as far as they
      can go, then push them down as far as they can go right before
      closure-conversion?

      (actually, pushing them down is not necessarily important, since
      in these examples all the calls are direct)

self-test: allocate and then free (check early before gc)

unsigned comparisons
signed division

VERY BAD: semantics of language-level div and machine-level div are
different; this is probably true for sub and add too. It's critical
that these match up!
