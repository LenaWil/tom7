I think that the result of certain primops (alert) can return a 'unit'
value that the compiler/runtime expects to be represented as {}. But
instead it gets the value "undefined", which can cause some minor
problems. 

There are many self-checks (e.g. closure conversion checks that it
produces closed code) that are redundant to type checking and other
later checks. We ought to run these only when a "paranoid" flag is
set.


 Should support "extern mobile type" (easy, just check
 mobility with concrete type at link time); see Dagstuhl
 talk for compelling example.

Passes to implement:

CPS Optimization
  * there are some optimizations now, but they should be expanded.
    especially good would be inlining and unused argument removal. (dicts)
  * 'known' names subterms and therefore could interfere with later arguments.
    an inlining phase would undo this.
  * already-bound, prevent recreation of things that are already bound
    (subsumes x = y renaming optimization)

    Things to clean up

Extraneous keywords from old compilers.
Labels support "special" labels; not needed.

    Old bugs from Humlock; mostly obsolete

BUG: nullary is wrong; we define LESS as nullary and later as exp * exp, and then we can never use LESS.


BUG: exhaustiveness warning in bug-exhaust.uml

unsigned comparisons
signed division
