(* Known is an optimization pass that reduces elimination
   forms where the object is a known introduction form.

   As a result this implements direct calls, since it
   reduces the idiom

   let closure = pack ...
   in
      unpack closure as f, env
      in 
      call(f, env, args)

   In order to conservatively apply this transformation,
   we need the arguments to the known introduction form
   to be small. Otherwise, we might apply this for multiple
   uses and cause a blow-up in size. (This is especially
   true for the above case when f is a literal lambda.)
