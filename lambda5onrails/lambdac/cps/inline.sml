(* Inlining is the process of removing a variable binding by carrying
   out the substitution. In order to prevent a blow-up in the size of
   the program, we should only do this when the bound value is "small"
   (about as costly as a variable occurrence) or when we believe that
   after inlining it the program will reduce to something smaller.

   The external language allows function declaratinos to be marked
   as "inline," which advises this pass to do the inlining. This is
   accomplished by a value constructor Inline that indicates that the
   value within it should be inlined. (We can't always inline it,
   so sometimes this has no meaning.)

   We can also inline whenever a variable is used only once (or
   never). This will turn out to be important, because polymorphic,
   valid functions are converted in a way that is difficult to
   directly inline, until an inner inlining has bee performed. The
   code produced for the identity function ( id ~ 'a -> 'a ), marked
   inline by the programmer, is

   letsham id_2 =
      sham _ .
        /\ cat_4 .
            vletsham id_7 =
               sham _ .
                 INLINE
                 lams
                 #0 is _ (x : cat_4, ret_5 : (cat_4) cont) = call ret_5 (x)
                 .0
            in
               ~id_7

   The inside of the /\ (alllam) is a vletsham, which prevents us from
   noticing that the body is inlinable unless we are exceedingly clever
   (we're not). But that body has the form
      vletsham x = (sham w. val')
      in  ... value with one use of x ...
   which can safely be reduced to
      [ ([world/w]val')/x ]value
   where world is the world of value.

   after that we have

   letsham id_2 =
      sham w.
         /\ cat_4.
            INLINE lams 
              #0 is _ (x : cat_4, ret_5 : (cat_4) cont) = call ret_5 (x)
                 .0
   
   which can be seen to be inlinable, even if id is used many times.
