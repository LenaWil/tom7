(* Prior to closure conversion we perform a translation to establish
   an invariant: that every bound type variable within a value or
   expression has associated with it in context a value that
   corresponds to that type's dictionary. (At this level, a dictionary
   is an abstract thing; ultimately it will be used to contain the
   marshaling functions for the type so that polymorphic code can
   transfer data over the network.) The output of this translation
   achieves the binding invariant by a set of representation
   guarantees, which are listed below.

   Type variables are bound in only three places in the CPS language.
   The AllLam construct abstracts over worlds, types, and values. The
   ExternType imports an abstract type and binds it to a variable. The
   third is the TUnpack construct, which unpacks a existential type.
   However, we do not expect to see TPack and TUnpack until after
   closure conversion, so we do not translate them here. In all cases,
   the bound type has kind 0, so we do not need to worry about
   dictionaries taking other dictionaries.

   Type variables are bound by the type constructor Mu as well, but not
   by the corresponding term constructors. We do not need to worry about
   these type variables at all because they cannot appear in terms.

   Representation Invariant 1: For AllLam { worlds, types = t1..tn, vals = x1..xm, body },
   m >= n and x1..xn are the dictionaries for the types t1..tn, respectively.

   Representation Invariant 2: For AllApp { f, worlds, types = t1..tn, vals = v1..vm },
   m >= n and v1..vn are the dictionaries for types t1..tn, respectively.

   Representation Invariant 3: For ExternType (v, lab, vlo, _), vlo is SOME (v', lab')
   where lab' is a symbol standing for the dictionary for the abstract type at the
   label lab.

   (the following two are irrelevant here since there will be no tpacks/tunpacks,
    but they will be introduced in CPS conversion)

   Representation Invariant 4: For TUnpack, the first element of the list will always
   be the dictionary for the type existentially bound.

   Representation Invariant 5: TPack always packs a list (dict :: ...) as in #4.
