
The Dagstuhl meeting resulted in a number of "challenge problems" "basic" web programming benchmarks/baselines
(specifically:
   https://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/cgi/wiki/proglang/extern/wiki.py/Dagstuhl07051/LeadingQuestionsa
 )

  *   wiki/blog
     o      users can add content
     o      versioning 
        + "live" 
          client side rendering (but needs server-side info, e.g. the existence of pages
                                 so they can be redlinked)
  *   mini eCommerce (catalog order app). Not THE wine store, but something with a clean spec. 
  *   hotel selection with appropriate user interaction pattern
     o      user explores graph of options, needs to move back and forth through space
        +         without losing context 
     o      want back/clone/refresh to have sensible semantics from user perspective 
  *   client-side mashup (e.g., Yaggle)
  *   draggable lists and similar UI functionality
  *   chat


web games as challenge problem

    * hard to do using standard web components
    * synchronizing multiple browsers difficult
    * scaling/performance issues in the presence of shared state

Flickr as challenge problem ("rich" GUIs as challenge?)

    * photos can be part of multiple albums
    * coordinating little web widgets, animations, etc.
    * how to do this stuff w/o 1000's of lines of JScript?
    * what is the right GUI toolkit for the web?
    * how to do fancy stuff while maintaining ability to access web in a lightweight way?
    * easy stuff is easy, hard stuff practically impossible (on the web)
