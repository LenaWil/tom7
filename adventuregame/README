   Adventuregame Test                Tom 7      15 Feb 2006

This is a test of infrastructure for building (sierra/lucasarts-style)
adventure games in Flash. Unfortunately, one cannot run or edit this
software without the Flash editor.

Status: Some very basic things work (doors between rooms, scaling of
player, messages). Some other critical features are not yet in place,
such as working inventory.
