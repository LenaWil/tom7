Utility functions of general interest.

listutil     -  Utilities for managing the built-in 'a list type.

stringutil   -  Utilities for manipulating the built-in string type.

util         -  General utilities.

maputil      -  Utilities for the njlib "ord map" type.

setutil      -  Utilities for the njlib "ord set" type.

fsutil       -  Utilities for the filesystem.

streamutil   -  Utilities for manipulating streams (parse/stream-sig.sml).

growarray    -  Arrays that can be appended to, growing automatically.
                Growmonoarray works for monomorphic arrays, more efficiently.

vectorutil   -  Utilities for the built-in polymorphic vector type.

simplestream -  Some libraries use (unit -> 'a option) functions as a
                simple imperative stream that does not need a dependency
                on anything but the basis. Clients might like to use
                these utilities for them.

script       -  Utilities for simple scripting tasks.

reutil       -  Utilities for using the SML/NJ regular expression library.
                Its stream-based design requires some contortions to use,
                even for simple stuff. re.cm gets you everything you need
                to call these functions, which only use base types.
