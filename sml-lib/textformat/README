textformat is a metautility for generating human-readable and editable
text files that can be transformed to and from SML data structures. It
includes a compiler, tfcompiler, that turns description files (.tfdesc) into
standalone SML that contains a predictable API based on that description,
including ways to read and write the textfile format.

Comparison:

 - Google Protocol Buffers are nice, but the binary format is completely
   uneditable and the text format is way too verbose. They also are more
   suitable for curly-style languages. Someone should make a protocol
   buffer implemetation for SML though, maybe me.

 - It is not XML because XML is awful in so many ways. You can use the
   XML parser in ../files/xml. Good luck.

Design considerations:

 - This is not a general serialization format; you will often need to
   do additional processing to transform to your own internal SML
   representation.

 - Backwards and forwards compatibility are supported, like in protocol
   buffers, by having the description include the names of the tags.
   Unlike protocol buffers, we don't support round-trip compatibility.
   If you parse it, you discard the fields that you don't understand.

 - The text format is designed to support efficient diffs and feasible
   merges in revision control systems, yay.

 - When possible I favor simplicity of usage over stuff like complexity
   of the internal code or performance.
