(* The convex polygon shape. The maximum number of vertices is given in
   settings.sml; since these must be convex there's not usually much reason
   to make it larger than the default. Complex shapes are typically made
   of multiple polygons linked together.

   More code pertaining to polygons is in collision.sml, to mimic the
   organization of Box2D.
