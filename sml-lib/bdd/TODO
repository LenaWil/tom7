
Test time-of-impact, dynamic-tree, and broad-phase.


Replace awkward vec2normalize with calls to vec2normalized.

Generally: Track down imperative access to vec2, mat22, and transform.
Replace with functional ones.

Replace vec2 with real * real.
Replace mat22 with real^4.

Replace initialize_manifold with create_manifold or something.

The type manifold should probably be a datatype. It seems to be used
that way, and it's annoying to allocate empty arrays and let them go unused.


in dynamics, make contact fixture_{a,b} non-optional. I bet they are always SOME after initialization

maybe some more things that can be made non-optional.

looks like I wrote common/*.cpp in a number of comments where I meant collision/*.cpp.

be consistent about broadphase vs. broad_phase in identifiers


export each module's exception.


Potential bugs:

check that FLAG_ISLAND (etc.) are fully qualified, since if a structure is open we might
accidentally refer to the wrong one, which if it has a different value would be a very
nightmarish thing to track down

b2ContactSolver - big, mathy.

island - started; guts missing

body - missing some guts

fixture - some small stuff missing

joints - everything. I just stubbed it out so that
I could write the calling code, but none have
been implemented. Should be able to test without
joints.
