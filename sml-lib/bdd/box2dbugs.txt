
Notes from my porting project, to send to the author; most are just
typos:


b2Collision.h:

  "///< not use for Type::e_points"
  There's no manifold type e_points (any more?)

b2PolygonShape.cpp:

  "It's location doesn't" -> "Its location doesn't"
  (in both copies of this code :))

b2Distance.h:

  The comment for the b2DistanceInput struct is incomplete. (?)

  The comment for b2Distance mentions b2EdgeShape, which doesn't seem
  to exist. Moreover, the code doesn't care about shapes at all; it
  just uses the proxies in the input.

b2Distance.cpp:

  Is the break inside b2Distance ("ensure progress") supposed to
  be commented out? If it is, then there's some dead code, like all
  of the distanceSqr calculations.

  In the guts of the GJK loop, the declaration
  b2Vec2 wBLocal;
  is dead.

  "still no overlapped" -> "still not overlapped"

b2DynamicTree.h:

  "perform a exact" -> "perform an exact"

  The comment

    // Separating axis for segment (Gino, p80).
    // |dot(v, p1 - c)| > dot(|v|, h)

  appears out of place in the RayCast function before it is repeated
  in a meaningful spot.

b2DynamicTree.cpp:

  The "find the best sibling" loop is an if..do..while which is
  exactly equivalent to a simpler while loop.

  
b2BroadPhase.h:

  "call UpdatePairs to finalized" -> "call UpdatePairs to finalize"

b2BroadPhase.cpp:

  "and add them pair buffer" -> "and add them to the pair buffer"

b2TimeOfImpact.cpp:

  The return value of b2SeparationFunction::Initialize isn't used.
  This might be better as a constructor.
  

b2Fixture.h

  "@param xf the shape world transform." There's no such parameter.

  "This AABB may be enlarge" -> "... enlarged"


b2Body.h

  "Creates a fixture and attach it to this body" -> 
  "Create" or "attaches" (both times)

manual.html:

Several of the examples in the manual.html write "b2Transfrom" instead
of "b2Transform".

In the graphic illustrating "contact manifolds", the caption in the
diagram for circle-polygon collision says "two points, one normal",
which isn't right.

In the fixture density section, this sentence was abandoned:

"The mass of a body is automatically adjusted when you "


b2Contact.cpp

In b2Contact::AddType the argument is called "destoryFcn" instead of
"destroyFcn".

b2World.h


The documentation for "DestroyBody" is kind of nonsensical because it
is mostly a copy of CreateBody.

Incomplete comment for GetContactList:
