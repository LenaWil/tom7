This directory contains some standard data structures. Also see the
parallel directory "algo" since it is sometimes difficult to
distinguish an algorithm from a data structure.

queue.sml  -  Efficient functional queues (double-list trick).
lastn-buffer.sml  -  Efficient fixed-length array (circular buffer).
trie.sml  -  Standard trie data structure, functorized.
