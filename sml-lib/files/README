A collection of modules for reading and writing file formats.

reader-sig.sml             
reader.sml             An abstract interface to "readable" things
                       (with the ability to do arbitrary seeking);
                       currently files on disk or in memory. This
                       is also useful for parsing packets in a
                       binary oriented network protocol.

                       (Note that files are currently loaded into
                       memory, so this implementation is not 
                       efficient for large files yet!)

elf - Reads ELF "executable and linking format" files. This is
      incomplete, but could be useful if you just need minimal
      functionality.

midi - Reads standard MIDI files into a stream of events. This is
       pretty much complete, except for some support for obscure
       features like split SYSEX data. However, the interpretation
       of the MIDI data is left to the user...

mp3 - Read/write MP3 ID3v1.1 tags.

wave - Write AIFF 'WAVE' files.

netpbm - Reads a subset of the trivial netPBM graphic format.

xml - Andreas Naumann's FXP parser (only) for XML. BSD-like license.
      This parser is highly featureful, but complex to use. I provide
      simplified interface in xml/xml-sig.sml.
