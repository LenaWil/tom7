
Algorithms and data structures for computational geometry.

polygon        -  Abstract representation of polygons.

quadtree       -  (Actually kd-trees.) Stores points in two-dimensional 
                  space, and supports efficient queries for all of the
                  points within a circle.

pointlocation  -  Given a bunch of non-overlapping polygons, quickly 
                  return the polygon that a point is in.
