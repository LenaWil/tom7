I use these files to make my code compile in SML/NJ, MLton, and other
ML compilers. SML/NJ and MLton in particular provide some common
functionality (e.g. exception history) 

I use this single conditional .cm declaration to include the proper
port file (as well as the basis, whose declaration is required in
SML/NJ and not in MLton).

#if (defined(SMLNJ_VERSION))
 $/basis.cm
 port/port-nj.sml
#else
 (* assume we are using mlton then *)
 port/port-mlton.sml
#endif


TODO: Obviously, these Port structures badly need a corresponding PORT
signature!
