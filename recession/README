       Recession                 23 May 2010

Recession is a simple RSS aggregator. You configure it with some RSS
URLs, and it periodically fetches them and merges the results with
a mysql database.

When I say simple I mean simple for me. This requires mlton, sml-lib,
sdlml, and mysql to install. Probably there is some linux package you
can just install that works better for normal people.
