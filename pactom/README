neighborhoods.kml -   KML file containing Pittsburgh's neighborhoods
                      as polygons. Based on the PDF maps from the
                      Pittsburgh map room and believed to be public
                      domain.

                      The maps are fairly accurate (borders closely
                      track landmarks like roads, rivers, and train
                      tracks when possible). Curves are approximated
                      with line segments. Borders that go through
                      wooded areas (etc.) are eyeballed as well as
                      I could from the PDFs, which also appear to
                      be eyeballed.

                      Currently in this file (because it is in
                      progress) the points do not coincide exactly,
                      but makepoints.sml shows how to normalize this
                      with the sml-lib polygon library. A future
                      version of this kml will probably have them
                      normalized by default.
