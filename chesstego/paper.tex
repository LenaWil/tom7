% results:

% No mate in 12 for 0-7. 6 ran for like 2 full days!
% regular board.

% Regular board still:
% No mate in 14 for 1,2,3,4,5,7. didn't run 6 because 6-ply took
% 2 full days!
% 0 finally finished with no mates found.

% No mate in 10 for king at pawn index 0-7, even when
% white's pieces are all queens (but the king)
% (6 also finished last. Is this the weakest spot?)

% No mate in 10 for white having ``mega'' pieces

% Mate in 10 for pawn idx 0! 441450 tree 
%                 and idx 1! 210316 tree

% TODO: We always have to explore all of black's moves, but we
% can push the search much deeper (if we just want to prove the
% existence of mate) by prioritizing white's moves. e.g., on the
% last move, only move to capture the king; and on the second-to-last,
% only move into check.

% TODO: Generate ``book'' where white is making strong moves
% (black has few options) but black keeps it going for 10/12 moves?
