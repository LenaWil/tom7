 * option to merge up short measures for genscore (foof.mid)

 * low watermark filter for 0-length MIDI notes (goog.mid drums, sigbovik?)


canyon.mid can't be read??

noise pitch? (with lowpass/highpass?)

too many simultaneous noise notes sounds very bad
   (maybe fixed this. there was a channel-polyphony bug, 
    and I turned down the default volume)


SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout works but has ridiculous latency.
dsound doesn't work, but should have better latency. can we make it work?
 (this worked at one point, wtf?)
 (oh, you have to use the pre-built SDL dll from escape in order
  to get dsound support.)


libjpeg on mingwin...
