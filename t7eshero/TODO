For demo:

 * Profile editor (at least name, pic)
 * Some recognizable non-free songs

 * Rate the existing song list, or improve through genscoring?

 * A few more items

 * Noise shaping?

items:
  coconut bra
  facial tongue  
  ...

Not tonight:
 * Failing in a song
 * turn off same-note hammer and first-note hammer through postprocessing


--------------------------------------------------

More midi triage. Did the whole cake\ dir, but need cake\also and cake\newsongs ....
   left off in cake\also  at now.wrk.

 * go through songs and try removing -noxmeasure; should usually make it better.

 * crashes ???

 * stdafx needs help during the fun part, merging notes from the basss
 * rt2i needs some volume adjustment, mainly turning down the big squares

 * cats.wrk
 * robots in general (but 1 track, argh)
 * Powerade could be fun but needs track 0 to be split
 * Maybe hock is possible, needs lots of tuning
 * Marriage too, but it needs some splitting
 * H4x0r
 * Verizon (awesomly weird)
 * Visa! (needs splitting too, until track 5 comes in)
 * Amy (needs splittin)
 * dental (weird)
 * police?
 * quarterl?

 * honk-honk is sorta too long.

 * fix scoring

 * improve performance of DP algorithm (space usage)

 * option to merge up short measures for genscore. x-measure option does
   a pretty good job on most songs.

 * low watermark filter for 0-length MIDI notes (goog.mid drums, sigbovik?)

 * drum kit samples? Would be pretty easy to play samples.

 * noise pitch? (with lowpass/highpass?)

 * more instruments, especially rhodes.

canyon.mid can't be read??


SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout works but has ridiculous latency.
dsound doesn't work, but should have better latency. can we make it work?
 (this worked at one point, wtf?)
 (oh, you have to use the pre-built SDL dll from escape in order
  to get dsound support.)


libjpeg on mingwin...
