canyon.mid can't be read??

noise pitch? (with lowpass/highpass?)

too many simultaneous noise notes sounds very bad


SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout works but has ridiculous latency.

 (this worked at one point, wtf?)
 (oh, you have to use the pre-built SDL dll from escape in order
  to get dsound support.)


libjpeg on mingwin...
