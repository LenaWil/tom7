
Items are like this:

RedGuitar | Red Guitar | guitar1.png |0|77| guitar2.png |0|77| guitar3.png |0|77| guitar4.png |0|77|   5

where the first field is the unique canonical name for it, and the
second field is a freeform description in-game. Then there are four
triplets of filename and x/y offset, for the four frames of the robot
animation. (Note that the frames will ping-pong.) Finally, the z-index
indicates the order in which items will be drawn. Numbers closer to
negative infinity are drawn first. The robot is drawn at 0, which is
an illegal z-index for an item. Ties are broken by lexicographic
ordering on the canonical name.
