USB cable to plug in ICD2 and to plug womb into computer. I have
an extra sitting around so I only got this one. It's long so I
can jump around while performing:

I ended up getting these lasers, though there are cheaper ones out
there that I didn't trust:  8 @ $14.95

Pretty good for calculating resistance values:

In the bag mike brought:

big orange orange black: 33 ohm
smaller orange blue black: 36 ohm
(looks like some red blue black too? 26 ohm)


LED calcs.
For input voltage 7.22v

  The big LEDs want 65--80mA at 3.2v. 56-66ohm is good. (two big ones in series)

  The small yellow LEDs: 16-18 mA at 2.2v. 330 ohm is good.

  Lasers: 35mA at 3.1v. 120ohm is good.


Output bits on 4550 usb board:
Basically all the unconnected pins can be put in digital I/O mode.

All D ports are I/O:
RD0,RD1,RD2     (RD3 is on-board LED, can be jumpered off)
RD4,RD5,RD6,RD7

All these C ports can be I/O:
RC0,RC1,RC2
RC6,RC7

Also these:
RE0,RE1,RE2

All these A ports can be I/O:
RA0,RA1,RA2,RA3,RA4,RA5

RB0-RB3 can be digital I/O:
RB0,RB1,RB2,RB3
