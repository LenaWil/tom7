Show #2, Fat Baby!!

TODO important:
 - Make sure it compiles and still works on OSX
 - Make setlist
 - Remove spurious printouts

 - Support for venue / boss graphics in setlist
 - On title screen, don't leave crumbs on right

 - sew luggage

 - improve minigame:
   - blink balls as they hit, to emphasize that this
     is timed with the melody
   - find a good song to use; something with lots
     going on but a simple loud melody

TODO nice:
 - "write failed." continuously on mac os"
 - New lights effects, like metronome, all on with beat
 - Make flashing background in time with music
 - Fade out "previous" stats instead of disappearing
   * light patterns when streak, FC, etc.
 - When song is going badly, caption "audience booing"
 - Extreme streak text

 - rutgers.mid!
 - star crystal journey
 - credits
