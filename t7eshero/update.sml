(* Updates files to match the versions on the server. This is much
   simpler than the escape ugprade system since users don't upload
   songs. We also don't attempt to upgrade the binary itself, for now.
   (That's actually easy on Linux and OSX but I think Windows is
   the most likely platform since you don't need any funny drivers
   for that.)
   
   Updating works like this. We fetch a file at a known URL from the
   t7eshero server for the platform (platform.manifests) which lists
   all of the available components for that platform:

   component1   r   This is some required component.
   component2   o   This is an optional component.
   component3   o   This is another optional component.

   Each filename (first field) is the name of a manifest available in
   that same directory. The next token indicates whether the component
   is required or optional. The player is subscribed to a component n
   when he has the file componentn.subscribed in the game directory,
   or when the component is required. (Some .subscribed files ship
   with the game so that those components are subscribed by default.)
   Each line ends with a description for that component, which can use
   font codes or whatever.

   Each componentn has a manifest at a known url (componentn.manifest),
   which looks like this:

   filename      u     SHA1-or-command\n
   filename      u     SHA1-or-command\n
   filename      u     SHA1-or-command\n
   filename      u     SHA1-or-command\n
   
   u stands for uncompressed, the only file encoding that we currently
   support. The filename uses forward slash to indicate relative
   subdirectories (.. and absolute paths should be rejected).
   Subdirectories are created automatically. SHA1-or-command is either
   the SHA1 hash of the contents of the file, or a * indicating that
   the file should be deleted if it exists. (This allows us to rename
   or remove files as part of the update process.)

   After reading the manifest, the client checks to see if it has
   those files. If its files match the manifest, we are done.
   Otherwise we confirm with the user that we want to do an upgrade,
   then we download each of the files that we need in order to
   complete the installation. These are found in some known directory
   root on the HTTP server, following the same directory structure and
   filenames as in the manifest. If all are successful, we move away
   the old versions, then move in the replacements. We should then
   tell the various modules in the application to reload their stuff,
   if necessary.

   TODO: Platform-specific manifest that allows updating the game and
   its libraries.
