TODO:
 - MUSIC
 - fish acceleration should affect physics, especially when on a wall.
 - some kind of pinball game inside the fish.
 - stuff in the background to indicate motion and give atmosphere
 - improve fish ai to keep them from bunching up
 - improve physics
 - orange eating frame
 - tower of fishes on-screen
 - animate radar when swallowing/regurgitating
 - start screen. Might even need instructions if the controls aren't arrows.
 - end screen (lighthouse?)
    - pearl in clam?
