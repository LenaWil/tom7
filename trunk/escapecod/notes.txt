TODO polish:
 - orange, cyan, etc. eating frame
 - put swallower at highest depth
 - improve debris (colors, sinus motion)
 - Sound effects for swallowing, escaping
 - fade out during end anim (falling)
 - fade out / hide other fish during swallowing
 - scale out for big fish

TODO: 2 hours left
 - more fish!

Probably not:
 - improve physics [1h]
 - some kind of pinball game inside the fish. [2h]
 - fish acceleration should affect physics, especially when on a wall. [.5h]
 - improve fish ai to make it look more like swimmin [.5h]
 - improve fish tower ui [.5h]

Entry:

Game made from scratch in 48h for Ludum Dare 21. All legit. 

This was a weird theme for me since I've been working on a game (of and on) for about 13 years called "Escape". You can play it at http://escape.spacebar.org/ but that is NOT the Ludum Dare entry. I wish. This game is called "Escape Cod" and it's kind of like recursive fish pinball. Play with the arrow keys and spacebar (you may need to click in the window first).

Enjoy:
 - Pleasant pastel title screen
 - Frantic pun-based gameplay
 - Sleeping with the starfishes
 - Three ultra-new tunes, one eponymous, with lyrics
 - Almost believable physics using real-style maths

Win screen unspoilered by screenshots.

Timelapse with webcam coming soon.
