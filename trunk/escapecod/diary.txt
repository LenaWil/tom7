\par
(I probably won't get much done tonight..)\par
\par
OK, verified that cam stuff is working.\par
\par
The game is called "Escape Cod" and it's about getting out of a fish.\par
\par
Actually, lots of fish: Because before you even get out of one of the fishes, the fish you're in might be swallowed by a bigger fish.\par
\par
This was Ryan's idea, FYI.\par
\par
I need to figure out what the basic gameplay mechanic is while you're inside a fish, though. I love platformers but I don't really want to make another one. And I'm loathe to do physics on arbitrary vectors. :( It's just a huge nightmare...\par
\par
I probably need to do it no matter what. Anyway, some of the ideas I've been considering are: Maze. Straightforward platformer. "Pitfall"-style rope swinging. Swimmy physics like Asteroids or Jellyfish. Pinball. Pool. Mini-golf. In each of this the gameplay quirk would be that the cod you're in is swimming around, which is disruptive to what you're trying to do. All of these need some kind of physics anyway, so might as well bite the bullet. I'm sort of leaning towards pinball, and maybe even randomizing the layout of the junk so that each fish is a new adventure. Whatever it is, it has to be something reasonably small so that you can see what's happening while your fish is swimming around...\par
\par
With a target of a "normal" size monitor, this is about as much room as I could imagine having for gameplay, which is small but not ridiculously small.\par
\par
To give a sense of scale, could do a "heads-up display" like this...\par
\par
(I'd want it to be a bit more line-drawey.)\par
\par
This would show your fish in the context of the world and maybe how "deep" you are.\par
\par
Conceivably you could be controlling (or influencing) the fish as well as the pinball (or whatever) game, for two player excite-ment. Or you can get that NES robot "Rob" to help you...\par
\par
(It would make no sense of course for a pinball to get larger as it exits the fish, but in order to preserve scale as we "zoom out", this would sort of be necessary? Maybe something else should be the player character, like a polyp? or maybe just a jellyfish?\par
\par
THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS WITH SOME BEER.\par
\par
Okay, problem not actually solved yet. :)\par
\par
Don't worry there are 2800 minutes left!\par
\par
It's pretty cramped in there, but it does look decent at least.\par
\par
If this was the whole game and not a joke, we'd certainly want to lay out the fish bodies manually, since otherwise we would need to worry about them being hard/impossible. That's fine though -- 10 different layouts would be more than plenty and the graphics can be more customized that way, which is more fun for me and the player. So if pinball, then customized. I can reuse the basic elements and restyle them.\par
\par
The pinball doesn't look that ridiculous when there is other pinball gear around...\par
\par
When swallowed by another fish, the background color could change to show you that you're inside one? This would interfere with my ideas for beautiful sea dust backgrounds, though I guess there could be sea dust inside a fish too.\par
\par
When I escape the red fish and it zooms out to show me that I'm inside the magenta one, what happens to the red fish? Can he still eat me? Probably not a good idea -- the "danger" should come from being eaten at the outermost level because we're too slow.\par
\par
Note that this will happen all the time: We can't just flip the playing field within a fish!\par
\par
ugh I hate tweens!\par
\par
Scaling the pinball looks fine actually...\par
\par
I think I could fade out the inner fish's pinball guts and fade in the outer fish's.\par
\par
The inner fish should do something, like dissolve? Otherwise it's gonna be taking up space for sheazy.\par
\par
I think I am going to get some sleep so that I have energy tomorrow, since I think this is a pretty good scope for the game and I will benefit from designing in my sleep.\par
\par
There are two things that worry me the most: The fiddlyness of getting the transitions to look good (this is essential to the "cleverness" of the game coming through) and the physics (essential to the pinball playing well). I don't think it's too much for 48h though.\par
\par
goodnight moon!\par
\par
GOOD MORNING!\par
845 am saturday.\par
\par
Since I realized last time that these are impossible to read on the screen if I type a lot, I'm actually going to save the document and link to it.\par
\par
During the night I thought about alternative games, but I think it's best to go with this idea. Let's start! First thing's first: We need some basic collision detection inside of moving fish, plus the swallowing mechanic. We could have a simple game in there, but the game is nothing without fish swallowing.\par
\par
Let's roll!\par
\par
(now writing in notes.txt)\par
\par
\par
We also need its geometry. In the past I've used hitTest, which allows\par
me to check a point against an arbitrary movieclip, including one\par
that's hidden. I know how to do it. I also know that resolving the\par
collision is a nightmare, because you don't have any notion surface\par
normals or anything. It's just "is this point in or out" and it is not\par
stable when the movie clip moves or rotates or scales. For "is lands"\par
I rotated into a common configuration before doing the test. But the\par
plane would get stuck in the floor all the time.\par
\par
trying to see how bad it was in is lands? pretty bad.\par
\par
That might have just been bad because I tried to allow totally\par
arbitrary geometry. Smoother geometry made from lines would probably\par
be better. Best would be if I actually understood the geometry and\par
could do math.\par
\par
I don't think there's an easy way for me to draw and save polygons in flash, at least AS2. I mean I can draw them with the line tool but they just become artwork.\par
\par
I don't think there will be a lot of geometry so I can just use objects...\par
\par
I think this'll be okay.\par
We need some music!\par
\par
(I just wrote a bunch more in notes.txt) Here it is because I only want to use that for notes that I might delete and update, not diary thoughts:\par
\par
\par
Okay, I want to be able to make several different fish. So each fish\par
should not have too many animation frames. I need:\par
\par
Two states for the face part:\par
 1. Mouth "very open" (about to eat)\par
 2. Mouth "open" (possible to escape cod)\par
.. when the ball is inside the fish, we should always be in state 2.\par
\par
 3. Two+ animation frames of fins.\par
\par
Fish should look sort of dead behind the eyes, so that I don't have to\par
animate that too much?\par
\par
So a fish is a movie clip with:\par
\par
  - a bunch of 'Solid' objects that we use to build a bunch of\par
    oriented line segments from. These are the clip region.\par
\par
\par
\par
Actually let's talk about the whole world. At any given time, we're:\par
  - Inside a 'deepest fish'. The view is focused on this fish. We\par
    only keep track of its internal geometry.\par
  - Maintaining a list of outer fish that have swallowed us. We draw\par
    the fish's background color behind our fish. When we're in zoom-out\par
    mode, we replace that with a huge version of the fish, then zoom\par
    to animate replacing the inner fish with the outer fish.\par
  - Maintaining a set of fish for the "world", which is the outermost\par
    level for marine radar. These fish are scale-invariant and don't\par
    need to be consistent except for what the player views.\par
      - There's a problem here which is that the point of the marine\par
        radar was to give me some context for the movement of the\par
        fish that I'm super zoomed-in on. It's going to be moving\par
        around, which creates acceleration and makes the game harder.\par
        Also I want to be able to see the fish I'm in getting swallowed.\par
      - I considered having a bunch of marine radars. But I think the\par
        best thing to do is to have fish eating me at only the next\par
        level out. We'll need to do something that doesn't quite make\par
        sense in order to make those fish disappear when I exit my\par
        own, but we're kind of doing that anyway.\par
  - So the fish in the "World" is really just the next level out.\par
    These can be visually insinuated one level beyond my own.\par
\par
\par
\par
\par
All right, let's start writing some code (12 hours in?? jesus)\par
\par
I'm going to try to make this game with mostly a single "Game" object rather than trying to make the pieces "object-oriented", which is usually confusing for a 48h contest.\par
\par
Gonna need some breakfast, strangely. I almost never eat breakfast...\par
\par
all right, just need another coffee and let's bang this out.\par
\par
I fucking love coffee BTW\par
\par
I am trying hard to lay the right groundwork so that I can build the features I need. It's hard to anticipate everything...\par
Also I am getting blowed up with IMs\par
\par
okay maybe a little bit of objects for data encapsualtion\par
\par
correct the first time! :)\par
\par
as predicted, this collision stuff is a bitch.\par
But I am going to get it "right", and move on...\par
\par
this one also better work the first time ;)\par
\par
don't worry tom, 2000 minutes left\par
\par
ugh, bug was actually just some left-over test code!\par
\par
that was pretty close! typical floaty bullshit though :)\par
\par
OK, enough to start making the rest of the game. There's definitely more polish to do there having to do with sticky jittery shit!!\par
\par
time for a showereward\par
and ice creward\par
and soon coffreeward\par
\par
what in the world???\par
some day I should actually learn the semantics of actionscript because this kind of thing happens often...\par
\par
(turned out to be an aliasing bug.)\par
\par
I wrote a lot of code. Now a lot of weird stuff is happening!\par
\par
okay finally...\par
It seems like if you extend movieclip, the "member variables" are shared across all instances of that movieclip, which makes no sense to me. Doing it in the single Game.as now.\par
\par
This might be my favorite song ever, called "All I Need" by the Radio-head.\par
\par
Masks worked great!\par
I'm trying to get the basics together of displaying the radar and the other fish, then polish the transitions. If I can get to the point where the skeleton of gameplay is in place tonight, then I can spend all of tomorrow creating fishes and puzzles and adding polish, which would be pretty good.\par
\par
getting a headache. better have some water. maybe some ibuprophen too.\par
\par
Ugh, my tablet froze up. Now it's in relative mode. I gotta reboot?\par
\par
Rebooting is boring! But at least I can do some laundry to make procrastination productive!\par
\par
Oh damn I am getting hungry...\par
Chinese?? Seems wise...\par
See you soon...\par
\par
I got chinese!\par
now you have to watch me eat\par
\par
General Tso's soy protein!\par
I don't think it's "heart attack-proof" though.\par
\par
Sorry, eating takes time!\par
\par
If you are watching my video on youtube, search for badlipreading and watch them instead. :)\par
\par
BACK TO WORK!\par
\par
The next task is to get the radar working. I made icons for the little fish. OK, that basically works.\par
\par
Now, fish rotation.\par
I'm already resigned to the fish rotating so that he's upside-down when swimming left. There's no good solution to this since his stomach contains a puzzle, and it would be disconcerting for it to flip horizontally. I need to be careful mostly about how rotation affects the physics. This is kind of complicated since some things use screen coordinates (arrows, gravity).\par
\par
That was not so bad. Just one sign error. I want the fish to change his orientation in as he swims around, not just be a clock, duh...\par
\par
it is impossible to write computer software without calling atan2 at some point\par
\par
now online for all my adoring fans\par
\par
laundrum dare!\par
\par
Okay, let's get the fish exiting animation done now.\par
\par
That worked surprisingly well...\par
\par
This is coming together!\par
Fish can't get eaten yet though.\par
Also there is no game.\par
But you know it's getting somewhere when I sit there playing it despite there being no "game" yet.\par
\par
Laundrytime!\par
Folding@home!\par
\par
Okay, there's some polish I could put on zooming out, but it's pretty good now. Let's make a few more fish.\par
\par
Still can't stop playing. :)\par
red, purple, green, orange. Only takes like 10 minutes to make more, so I will make more.\par
\par
Goals for tonight:\par
 - "swallowing" support\par
 - display the tower of fishes \par
     on-screen.\par
 - write one song.\par
\b  - beer or scotch\par
\b0 cheers :)\par
\par
looks like I recorded two different webcam sizes-- this'll be fun to fix  ;)\par
\par
jesus, this program is pretty complicated.\par
\par
ok, it's sorta working!\par
\par
 - "swallowing" support DONE\par
\b  - beer or scotch DONE\b0\par
 - display the tower of fishes \par
     on-screen. NEXT.\par
 - write one song.\par
\par
