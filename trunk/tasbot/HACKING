
To compile with SDL it's quite an ordeal.
In 64-bit mode, you can't use binary libraries; you have to compile from source.
Get source for SDL-1.2.15 (or whatever) and SDL_net-1.2.8 (or whatever) and put
it in SDL and SDL_net subdirectories.

I didn't need to do anything for SDL_net; just compile the .c files
using the makefile in this dir. To build SDL I had to use SDL/configure.

cd SDL
CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ CFLAGS=-m64 CXXFLAGS=-m64 ./configure
make -j

I modified some of the SDL source to get it to compile
(straightforward). However, the library doesn't actually link -- it
seems to be generating a 32 bit version.o for some reason. Still,
linking against all the .o files in build/ seems to work, which is
what the makefile does.

Sorry, I did not invent SDL or mingw or shared libraries! :)


I had similar issues with protobuf. Configure like this:
CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ CFLAGS=-m64 CXXFLAGS=-m64 ./configure
make -j

and then I'm just linking against the .o files (and probably a
superset of what we need since that directory also includes the proto
compiler). The generated protoc.exe doesn't work (just is like a nop),
but a 32-bit version of it does; I already had that installed in my
path so in the makefile I just call "protoc".
