
Things to do or try:

At search time, weight changes in objective functions by the magnitude
of the change, not just the number that went up or down.

Search by an iterated random process, where we look at all the first
steps, some of the second, fewer of the third, etc.

Integrate over the values of intermediate steps when evaluating a plan.

If we are stuck issuing a very low value move, jump back in time and
randomize.

Instead of motifs of fixed length, try sequences of random varying length.

Consider making a simple markov model of inputs rather than fixed motifs.

Reweight motifs as you play.

Allow lex ordering to include -byte in addition to +byte, for things
that decrease.

Allow lex orderings that treat their bytes as signed?
