 Experimental automated search for optimal solutions to NES games.
 Currently, all that exists is a fork of the NES emulator FCEUX (GPL)
 that compiles cleanly on mingw for x64 windows. This is important
 because the search algorithm I have in mind will use LOTS of RAM; far
 more than the 2-3gb allowed on win32.

 The intended platform is 64-bit windows 7. There's no windows-specific
 stuff here, but compiling in this era is a nightmare and so I don't
 expect it to work straightforwardly on other platforms.

 The fceu subdirectory is the fork of FCEUX. I deleted a bunch of
 stuff from it. It is licensed under the GPL (see fceu/COPYING),
 including my modifications.

 This is currently a headless compile; no graphics or sound or input.
 It compiles for me with the makefile I built, after isntalling the
 cygwin packages like x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ (don't get the i686 ones;
 I hear they are a trap!). Make sure you get libz since it's required
 by this. Follow the instructions on http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/
 to make sure that it's running the right binary (this is all so very
 confusing), but I installed via cygwin and that worked and so that was
 +1 for cygwin.
