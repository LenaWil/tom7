Title theme song:
  It's dangerous to go      alone
  but you got another paw   to hold
  Maybe we better not?
  but we gotta catch that dot!
  and it's dangerous to go alone...

  It's dangerous to go     outside
  adventurous              implied

  It's dangerous to leave  the house
  Adventurous enough   to chase   a mouse

  shivering  in the abyss
  I'm glad I took my sis!

  cuz it's dangerous to go alone!



Win theme:

  we knew that down in that cave
  we would finally find the place

  where all the dots hang out
  and fly around and fly around

          C               G
  and now our adventure's done
          Dm       E-F
  endless stimulation
      A  G   F
  of radiation
    D+  A/C  G
  class I
  
     F+riff
  do not stare
  do not stare
  
  directly into the beam
