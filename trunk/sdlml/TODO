Need a coherent way to specify the initialization flags to SDL_Init,
which is in sdlml.c. We could:
   * expose an init function that the programmer has to call
   * functorize SDL over this flag so that it initializes itself
     like it currently does, but when the functor is instantiated (once!) 
   * leave a C symbol undefined and require that the client provide
     this symbol at link time (it's the flagset to use)

SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout works but has ridiculous latency.
dsound doesn't work, but should have better latency. can we make it work?
 (this worked at one point, wtf?)
 (oh, you have to use the pre-built SDL dll from escape in order
  to get dsound support.)
