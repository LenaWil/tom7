"merit badge" system of awards for doing various things (finding
secrets, winning without collecting the X, etc.) Should be tied to a
"session", not a particular savegame or play through the game. The
second time through the game, it should alert the user when a merit
badge opportunity is lost (e.g. "collect the X before the Y" displays
"merit badge opportunity lost" (not saying which one) when Y is
collected without X).
