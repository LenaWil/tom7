2 HOURS

Kinda needed:
  - drop things back into tray
  - finish title screen
  - hand drawing
  - burned drawing
  - soldering iron
  - taking goal
  - cell phone in hand

Basic
  - drop things back into tray
  - finish title screen
  - touch events
  - resize screen for iphone, ipad

Story Mode
  - in-game dialogue code
  - taking the goal
  - taking the goal a second time

Polish
  - when floating, object handle rather than assuming center
  - obvious performance issues
  - blink on desk anim

- index objects to speed up GetItemAt?


Jam maybeeeee...
2h Arcade Mode
  - Countdown timer
  - loops are destroyed (plus whatever's inside?)
  - Bonus time for making loops
  - Score
  - Maybe replace "Goal" & "Drag" with score / timer / next
  - arcade music


ideas / etc.


possible twists: 120v AC to 3.5mm headphone jack ? What are people DOING with these connectors?


Hi, I'm Jim. I work at Connector World. I make custom connectors
for people that have special connecting needs.

In this game I'll be "outsourcing" my job to you. I can do that
because you seem to think my job is a game, which is weird.
