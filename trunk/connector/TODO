possible twists: 120v AC to 3.5mm headphone jack ? What are people DOING with these connectors?


Hi, I'm Jim. I work at Connector World. I make custom connectors
for people that have special connecting needs.

In this game I'll be "outsourcing" my job to you. I can do that
because you seem to think my job is a game, which is weird.
