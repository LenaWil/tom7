This is a version of Box2D that generates traces, for comparison
with my source port to SML, called BoxDiaDia. Other than development
of BoxDiaDia, there's not much point to it -- it will be very slow
because of all the output, and the output is not readable or anything
like that. Moreover, the way I stuck the tracing printfs in there
is pretty gross.
