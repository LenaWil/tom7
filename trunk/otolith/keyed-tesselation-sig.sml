   coordinates, keyed by some functor argument. This allows the
   object's shape/location to be parameterized.

   The code is basically a copy of Tesselation with the idea
   that once it's working, it can also be used to implement
   tesselation where the coordinate key is unit.

     Only succeeds if this point is not one of the edge's vertices,

     internal edges, which are shared by two triangles. Flipping
     changes the edge to be between the unconnected nodes as shown,
     resulting in two different triangles. This is allowed:

               n2                           n2

     But for example not this one:

                    n3
                   .
                 ,`/

              n4

     since a new edge from n4 to n4 would leave us with two overlapping
     triangles (or if n3 and n4 are colinear, a degenerate triangle).

     When it can succeed, returned are the original edge, the point on
     it that's closest to the input point, and the potential new edge.
     No changes are made. This is the same edge used by flipedge
     below, when it can succeed. *)

     nodes to find it.
