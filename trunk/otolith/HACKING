
This wants mlton installed in c:\mlton. I couldn't get it to work
via make if there was a space in the path.

SDL and SDL_image go in subdirectories of this one. You just need the
include/ and lib/ files from the "devel" editions (for "VC",
definitely not mingw). Then put the x86 windows libraries (DLLs) in
this current directory (these are currently checked in).



Problems I had:

 - __imp prefixes linker errors. This was because mlton was generating
   dependencies on a DLL with _import. You need to say "public" or
   "private" to get a regular linktime thing.

 - The program ran and immediately exited. This was because I had the 64-bit
   DLLs in the current directory but was compiling for 32 bit.
