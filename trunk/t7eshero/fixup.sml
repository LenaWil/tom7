(* Tom 7 Entertainment System Hero!

   This program performs some tasks on MIDI files.
   
   Right now the only task is to set a "minimum watermark" length of a
   MIDI note. This is because the sound engine doesn't quite handle 0-length
   notes as well (that is, wrongly but good soundingly) as the SC-880, so
   they need to be bumped up to a few ticks to get the right sound.
