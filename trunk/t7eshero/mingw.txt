(* install first *)
get MinGW-something.exe from SOURCEFORGE PAGE

get MSYS.exe from bad page INSTALL SECOND


(* vs tools... *)
dumpbin /imports file.exe
        /dependents

you also need zlib and libpng and libjpeg and libtiff. (If you try to skip jpeg and tiff, configure will work but linking will fail??)
zlib builds with ./configure; make; make install
libpng builds with ./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib ; make; make install
  (since zlib puts its stuff in /usr/local for whatever reason..)

libjpeg builds with ./configure ; make; mkdir /usr/local/man/man1 ; make install ; make install-lib
 (* maybe those second to last two aren't necessary, but I did them search for install-lib *)

libtiff builds with ./configure ; make ; make install
                     (you may get illegal instructions in NTVDM??)

[the mingw "ports" do not work for me and anyway are only available for png]



to build SDL_image, first
export SDL_CONFIG=/path/to/explat/SDL/sdl-config
./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib ; make; make install

Then in /usr/local/bin/ copy libpng-3.dll to libpng13.dll   (?)

OK, you're set!



Note: according to 
  http://www.spacejack.org/games/mingw/mingw-sdl.html
      it's possible to just use the MSVC binary library (.lib)?
