mingw:

For SDL, it's set up so that you can just grab the "devel" libraries
from SDL.org (1.2 series) and put them in subdirectories "SDL_lib" and
"SDL_net". They should have subdirectories like include/ and lib/.

I think you need to also put the DLLs in the directory with the output
executables.
