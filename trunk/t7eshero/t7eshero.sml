         occurred between lt and now. This is the case when the delta time
         is less than or equal to (now - lt).

         There may be many such events, each measured as a delta from the
         previous one. For example, we might have

          then continue with lt=now. To do so, we call the period of time
          left to emit the 'gap'; this begins as now - lt = 7.

          We then emit any events with delta time less than the gap,
          reducing the gap as we do so. (We can think of this as also
          updating lt. Instead we just set lt to now when we finish
          with the gap.)

          When the gap is too small to include the next event, we reduce
          its delta time by the remaining gap amount to restore the
