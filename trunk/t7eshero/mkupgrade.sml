(* Makes a manifest file. See update.sml for information on what this
   file contains. 
   
   The manifest is created from two files: A file metafest, and a deletion
   metafest. Each is just a list of filenames; the file ones will be SHA-1'd
   and the deletion ones will be listed for deletion. The manifest is written
   on standard output.
