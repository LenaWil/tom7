More midi triage. Left off at spinal.wrk. (YEAH)


 * Powerade could be fun but needs track 0 to be split

 * Some kind of bug in genscore where identical adjacent chords might be
   rendered differently (because of sorting of the component notes?) (matrix.mid)

 * fix scoring

 * improve performance of DP algorithm (space usage)

 * option to merge up short measures for genscore (foof.mid, recanter.mid)

 * low watermark filter for 0-length MIDI notes (goog.mid drums, sigbovik?)

 * noise pitch? (with lowpass/highpass?)

canyon.mid can't be read??



too many simultaneous noise notes sounds very bad
   (maybe fixed this. there was a channel-polyphony bug, 
    and I turned down the default volume)


SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout works but has ridiculous latency.
dsound doesn't work, but should have better latency. can we make it work?
 (this worked at one point, wtf?)
 (oh, you have to use the pre-built SDL dll from escape in order
  to get dsound support.)
