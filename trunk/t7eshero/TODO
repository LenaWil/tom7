OS X:
 crazy white garbage on everything

For release:

 * Profile editor (at least name, pic)
 * Some recognizable non-free songs

 * Rate the existing song list, or improve through genscoring?
    .. particularly, pick out songs that are actually good and
       launch with those. Keep the rest in triage.

 * not all of the songs are checked in (chant, unauth, ..)
 * clean up the MIDIs checked into the main dir. not all are used.

 * A few more items
 * A few more profile pics

items:
  coconut bra
  facial tongue  
  ...

Not tonight:
 * Failing in a song
 * turn off same-note hammer and first-note hammer through postprocessing


--------------------------------------------------

More midi triage. Did the whole cake\ dir and cake\also dir, 
     	  	   but need cake\newsongs (next is laundry.wrk)
                   and other miscellaney (c:\cakewalk projects)

 * go through songs and try removing -noxmeasure; should usually make it better.

 * sigbovik should not loop twice. maybe should have lead vocals track.

 * crashes ??? (when running out of channels?)

 * kaomai needs -quantize option to genscore.

 * stdafx needs help during the fun part, merging notes from the bass

 * rt2i needs some volume adjustment, mainly turning down the big squares
 * goog could use drum volume boost

 * cats.wrk
 * robots in general (but 1 track, argh)
 * Powerade could be fun but needs track 0 to be split
 * Maybe hock is possible, needs lots of tuning
 * Marriage too, but it needs some splitting
 * H4x0r
 * Verizon (awesomly weird)
 * Visa! (needs splitting too, until track 5 comes in)
 * Amy (needs splittin)
 * dental (weird)
 * police?
 * quarterl?
 * New ones: Robin's Egg, Zurich...


 * Ohio is too long without another part. But it's a nice easy tune.

 * honk-honk is sorta too long.

 * fix scoring

 * improve performance of DP algorithm (space usage)

 * option to merge up short measures for genscore. x-measure option does
   a pretty good job on most songs.

 * move general purpose SDL stuff into ../sdlml/

 * more instruments, especially rhodes.

canyon.mid can't be read??


SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout works but has ridiculous latency.
dsound doesn't work, but should have better latency. can we make it work?
 (this worked at one point, wtf?)
 (oh, you have to use the pre-built SDL dll from escape in order
  to get dsound support.)


libjpeg on mingwin...
