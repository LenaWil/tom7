/*
  A music layer is a layer that generates audio musics. This
  is an abstract interface.

  Music is a function from sample time t to a multiset of notes. A
  note is itself a set of controllers; each controller at least
  includes frequency and amplitude, but the set of possible
  controllers is open. For example, a controller might set the
  duty cycle or phase of a square wave.
