Something like TriggerLayer for drums and sample-based music?
Or should this be integrated into MusicLayer?

Some way for layers to be cached, perhaps by wrapping them in a cache.

Generalize the idea of FirstSample and AfterLastSample to an intervalcover
for the layer. Get rid of FS/ALS.


Periodic waveform editor (graphical)

Ability to edit piano roll!

Background thread that renders the audio.

UI that shows rendering progress.

Some solution for making perfect loops for video games -- where
we have intro that enters some loop, and we solve for a "fixed point"
on the second loop (e.g. reverb), and perhaps then allow for an
outro.

Figure out the ownership of layers. Right now they just last forever.

Pan should optionally add intraaural delay.
