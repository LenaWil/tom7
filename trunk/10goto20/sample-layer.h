/*
  A sample layer is a layer that generates audio samples. This
  is an abstract interface.

  This is a common and basic layer that results from rendering
  of audio, like a synthesizer or sampler.

  A sample layer is a partial function from time (sample number) to
  amplitude. The layers are positioned in time, and do not necessarily
  have a beginning or end. For example, it may be an infinite 60 Hz
  sinewave with a specific phase or a drum sample that plays for 100ms,
  starting at sample #139741. Although sample layers have their own
  notion of timing, it makes sense to construct a new sample layer
  by offsetting or cropping an existing one.
