This is the barest beginnings of a non-realtime software "tracker" (or
something) for making music. Today it just displays a blank screen and
inefficiently plays a MIDI file with primitive waveforms. Eventually
the goal is for it to be a nice piano-roll style sequencer for electronic
music of my particular style (e.g., weird time signatures and so forth)
but with flexibility for new-sound style mess aroundery.

Design goals:
 - Don't try to be a DAW or MIDI editor. There are lots of these already.
 - Don't try to be "real time". Instead take advantage of the off-line
   nature to do things that "real time" synths don't do: Dependencies
   on future samples, expensive effects, deterministic rendering,
   global optimizations.
 - Don't be wimpy about resource usage. Require 64 bits, loads of RAM;
   expect lots of cores, maybe a GPU.
