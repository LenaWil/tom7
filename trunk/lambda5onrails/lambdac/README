The program lambdac compiles Lambda 5 on Rails code to client side
Javascript and server-side bytecode. Its lineage is complex:
    mtex -> hemlock -> aphasia2 -> humlock -> lambdac.

Hemlock is documented in "ML Grid Programming in ConCert" by Tom
Murphy VII in the SIGPLAN ML Workshop 2006. Humlock is described in
the 2006 Tech Report "The Cult of the Bound Variable: The 9th Annual
ICFP Programming Contest" (CMU-CS-06-163) and documented briefly in
the corresponding source release (http://boundvarible.org/).

Lambdac is documented in my upcoming dissertation and in the paper (to
appear in Trustworthy Global Computing 2007) "Type-safe Distributed
Programming with ML5."

Currently the CPS representation in the middle-end is engineered for
correctness, not speed. I've put some effort into improving its
performance, but on large ASTs this may take a very long time to
compile. (Large ASTs can arise from medium-sized programs, sorry.)
