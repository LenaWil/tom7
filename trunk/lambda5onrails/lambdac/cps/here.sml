(* This is a simple optimization that
   replaces
   
      leta x = hold(w) v

   with

      bind x = v

   whenever w is the world we're currently at.

   Since non-valid function declarations use
   this arrangement, it is important for
   enabling some other optimizations (e.g. 
   direct calls).
