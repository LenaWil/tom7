(* After closure conversion and undictionarying, all functions are
   closed to dynamic variables and uvariables. This means that we can
   hoist this code out of its nestled environs to the top-level and
   give it a global name. At run-time, we pass around these names
   instead of the code itself.
   
   Though the code is closed to dynamic variables, it may have free
   static (world and type) variables. When we extract the code from
   the scope of these variables, we need to abstract the code over
   those variables and apply it to them back in its original location.

   In fact, the code might be typed @ a free world variable. So the
   hoisted code might be polymorphic in the world at which it is typed,
   that is, valid. (Actually, we really parameterize the typing judgment
   here by the world, so the world parameter can appear in the type of
   the code as well, unlike with traditional valid things.)
