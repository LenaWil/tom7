wiki2 with simple AST: 
real	1m23.137s
user	0m47.000s
sys	0m2.060s


profiling off.
memoized, delayed sets:

real    0m54.860s
user    0m43.350s
sys     0m2.330s


eager sets. it seems that since we
use these so often, it actually hurts
to be lazy about them:

real    0m50.726s
user    0m40.330s
sys     0m2.410s
