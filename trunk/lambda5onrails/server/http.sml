(*
  http packetizer based on Tom's LinePackets.  It's kind of
  odd, because the the sizes of the headers and body of an
  http request are determined in different ways.  The headers
  run until a blank line (that is, CRLFCRLF).  The length of
  the body is deteremined by the Content-Length header line.

  The heart of this is the parse function.  It take a partial
  packet of the form (string * int option).  The string is the
  request received so far, and the int option is the value
  carried by the Content-Length line, if any.  Parse tokenizes
  this string by newlines.  It then splits the resulting list
  into two parts, headers and body, by finding the first
  CRLFCRLF pair.

  It then checks to see if it yet knows the value of
  Content-Length.  If it does, it checks to see if the whole
  body has arrived.  If the body is all there, it cuts out the
  amount of data required and returns SOME of that as the  second
  element of a singleton list of a tuple, the rest of the tuple
  being a list of the http headers, along with the partial packet
  that is the rest of the data not sent.  If it does not yet have
  the entire body, it returns nil and the partial packet containing
  all the data for the current request received so far.

  If parse does not have value of the Content-Length header, it
  checks to see if it has yet received a blank line as part of
  this request.  If it has, it returns everything up to the
  blank line as headers, and the rest of the data as the next
  partial packet.  If it has not, it returns nil and the
  partial packet containing all the data for the current request
  received so far.
