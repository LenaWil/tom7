(* This is a "simple" implementation of closure conversion.

   The Hemlock series of compilers had a very compilcated closure
   conversion algorithm that attempted to balance a number of
   constraints to produce as good code as possible. This led to a very
   complex and error-prone implementation. One of the reasons was that
   it was annoying to consider the implications of mutual recursion
   (and implement it), but difficult to just punt on that case without
   making the implementation incorrect.

   This language is much more complicated than the Hemlock CPS IL, so
   the closure conversion algorithm cannot be as ambitious. In
   addition to the new machinery having to do with the modal features,
   we also must maintain a dictionary-passing invariant (see dict.sml)
   during this translation.

   Therefore the new strategy is to do something simple and general,
   but then implement things like direct calls for the common case in
   a later optimization pass. This has the advantage that we can more
   easily punt on any difficult cases like mutual recursion. It also may
   subsume and/or be assisted by other optimizations like known-argument
   and tuple flattening optimizations. It also shortens the path to a
   working but slow compiler.

   Several things need to be closure converted. First, obviously, is
   the Fns expression, which is a bundle of mutually-recursive
   functions. The conversion of this is a little tricky because of
   mutual recursion. The straightforward thing is this:

   fns f(x). e1           ==>    
   and g(y). e2


    pack ( ENV ; [dictfor ENV, env = { fv1 = fv1, ... fvn = fvn },
          fns f(env, x). 
              let fv1 = #fv1 env      (except actually leta and lift; see proposal)
                    ...
                  (: create closures for calls to f and g within e1 :)
                  f = (pack ( ENV ; [dictfor ENV, env = env, f] ))
                  g = (pack ( ENV ; [dictfor ENV, env = env, g] ))
                  .. [[e1]]
          and g(env, y).
                  .. same ..
          ])

         where ENV is the record type { fv1 : t1, ... fvn : tn }.

   so the type |(a, b, c) -> d; (e, f, g) -> h|
   becomes     E ENV. [ENV dict, ENV, |(env, [[a]], [[b]], [[c]]) -> [[d]];
                                       (env, [[e]], [[f]], [[g]]) -> [[h]]|]

   And the type (a, b, c) -> d
   becomes     E ENV. [ENV dict, ENV, (env, [[a]], [[b]], [[c]]) -> [[d]]]

   So the question is, what to do with the fsel construct, which has this typing
   rule?

      e : | ts1 -> t1 ; ts2 -> t2 ; ... tsn -> tn | @ w      0 <= m < n
     ------------------------------------------------------------ fsel
                     e . m   :  tsm -> tm @ w

   the translation must take on this type:

      e : E ENV. [ENV dict, ENV, |(env :: ts1) -> t1; ...
                                  (env :: tsn) -> tn|] @ w      0 <= m < n
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ fsel?
       e . m   :  E ENV. [ENV dict, ENV, (env, tsm) -> tm]  @ w

   and it must be a value.

   There's only one way to do this. e.m must translate into 

   unpack e as (ENV; [de, env, fs])           <- unpack must be a value then
   in  
     (... maintain dictionary invt; see dict.sml ...)
    pack ( ENV ; [de, env, fs.m] ) 

   in many situations (especially for m = 0 and fs a singleton) we should be able to
   optimize this to avoid the immediate packing and unpacking.


   Question: is it really the best choice to have the fns construct
   dynamically bind the individual function variables within itself,
   or should it bind the bundle and then we use fsel to make friend
   calls? Both seem to work, but the latter seems a bit more uniform.


   Other features need to be closure converted as well. They are
   simpler but less standard.

   The AllLam construct allows quantification over value variables. We
   won't be able to evaluate the body of an alllam if it quantifies
   over value variables, since we won't know the values of those
   variables. So, we will closure convert it whenever there is at
   least one value argument. These lambdas are converted pretty much
   the same way as regular lambdas.

   { w; t; t dict } -> c

          ==>

   E env. [env dict, { w; t; env, t dict } -> c]



   Addendum     23 Aug 2007

   It turns out it's actually much more difficult to undo closure
   conversion than it is to do it somewhat well in the first place,
   and that bad closure representations account for a very significant
   fraction of the cost of running a program, in large part because
   closures require the reification of type information as
   dictionaries. So we also implement some common cases of direct
   calls, and should expand these. See case_Primop below.

  (* augmentfreevars ctx freesvars freevars freeuvars exemptargs

     When we compute the free variables of some value or expression,
     we also need to provide the dictionaries for some static parts,
     in order to preserve our invariant. Any free type variable must
     have its dictionary included. By free we mean type variables that
     actually occur, but also type variables that occur within type
     types of any free dynamic variables. (Essentially we can think
     of this as the free type variables of the derivation, not of the
     expression or value). We do the same for world variables, which
     are also represented.

     Note that we don't need to include a dictionary in this implicit
     environment if that dictionary is already an explicit argument to
     this function. This is particularly important for our shamrock
     translation, where the immediately embedded alllam is designed to
     establish the dictionary invariant, but also naively triggers the
     need for the dictionary! The 'exemptargs' argument to the
     augmentfreevars function is a list of arguments that will be
     bound directly, for the purposes of this culling.
