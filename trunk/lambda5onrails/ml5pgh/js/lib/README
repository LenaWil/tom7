This is a pared down version of Entain.com's MLton-licensed Javascript
library. I've ported it to use the regular standard basis library
and sml-lib instead of the MLton library and I've erased a lot of stuff
(parsing) that I don't need.

Allegedly this conforms to the following standard:

  ECMAScript Language Specification 
  Edition 3 Final
  24 March 2000

js.cm contains a very small test along with the libraries necessary to
compile.

The code in this directory (only) is licensed under the permissive
MLton license. See the file LICENSE for more information.
