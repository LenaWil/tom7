 Extensible types.


 A value of extensible type is the pair of the tag and the encapsulated
 value. In JavaScript, { t : tag, v : val }. In bytecode, Record(t=..., v=...).

 A tag is also a pair. It contains the address where the tag was generated,
 along with the serial number of the tag. (The address exists so that we
 do not need to correlate serial numbers across hosts.) For a valid tag that
 we import from the environment, like Match, the address can be anything 
 (I use "*") as long as it is consistent. (Note that these only need to be
 declared on the client since we do not have global values yet.)
