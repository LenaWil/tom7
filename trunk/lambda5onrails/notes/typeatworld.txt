It might be interesting to think about the judgment "A type" being
indexed by worlds as well. Perhaps "password type @ server" could be
an abstract type that can't even be mentioned at the client, giving
some kind of secrecy property?

I think this is promising. One of the things about the dictionary
invariant we use in the compiler is that the dictionaries must be
universal because types are universal. But if types are located, then
their dictionaries would also be located. This might make it easy to
prove a property of the implementation that a value of a located type
never escapes its home world... because there is no way to unmarshal
it at any other world without its representation. (?) (Notice that
the representation makes its way to the other world by being packed
into an existential package; only our invariant that we must put it
in a shamrock would prevent us from doing that.)
