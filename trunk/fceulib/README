This is Tom 7's attempt to make FCE Ultra into a thread-safe library.
As of 7 Sep 2015, we have here:

 - The modernization I did for the Learnfun & Playfun project
   (../tasbot/) and major culling of unnecessary parts of FCEU.
 - Transformed all of the modules into objects so they don't read
   and write global variables. Gosh, this was a huge pain in the ass!
   If you use this you may owe me a beer!
 - A new sensible interface in emulator.h.
 - A test suite in emulator_test. It includes the ability to
   instrument the emulator with tracing in case I introduce a bug
   and want to see why a game is behaving differently.

This code might work now, but I still need to do some testing. The
biggest risk at this point is not a lack of thread-safety (it's reasonably
easy to verify that there are no globals or 'static' declarations), but
that some piece of code accesses uninitialized memory and thus doesn't
have repeatable behavior. This may not matter for your application, so
go to town!

Note that this port requires C++11 and I have only tested 64-bit builds.
I am using x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++, which is GCC 4.9.2.
