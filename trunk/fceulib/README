This is Tom 7's attempt to make FCE Ultra into a thread-safe library.
As of 28 Dec 2014 there's no actual progress towards that except for
the modernization I did for the Learnfun & Playfun project
(../tasbot/) and some major culling of unnecessary parts of FCEU.
After I finish getting rid of that stuff (getting close), I'll make it
into a collection of classes and make it thread safe. The new
interface is in emulator.h and emulator_test contains a small test
suite to make sure I don't mess anything up as I transform the code.
