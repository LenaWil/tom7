Stuff I should be able to get rid of:

 - ines.cpp "trainerpoo"
 - file wrappers can be massively simplified
 - file archive support
 - new ppu?
 - auto-fire
 - video.cc can probably go?
 - autosave (fceu.cc mostly)
 - fceu.cc EmulationPaused

Cleanup to do:
 - loads of unnecesary gotos in sound.cc
 - for loops with shared index variable in sound.cc

Surprisingly necessary:
 - crc32 since ines.cc has a table of games and their CRCs.
 - cart md5ing
 - md5 in FECUGI; note I'm using md5 for RamChecksum though
    - If this gets threaded to cartinfo, we also need it
      for example for hack checks in onebus.cc


Possible performance improvements:
 - Can the ZNTable be replaced with a computation on the value itself?
   See my comment in x6502.cc.
 
 - Is it possible to remove the indirection when reading/writing memory,
   perhaps in a special case? Currently ARead is populated with a bunch
   of function pointers (including special regions installed by various
   mappers and cart types.)


Notes:
"CDLogger" is "code data logger", and I have deemed it unnecessary

Helper snippets:

alias files='find . -type f | grep -v .svn | grep -v ".o$"'
(defun find-mentions () 
 (interactive "")
 (let ((sym (thing-at-point 'symbol)))
    (message sym)
    (let ((cmd (concat "bash -c \"grep '"
	                sym 
	   	        "' `/bin/find . -type f | grep -v .svn | grep -v '.o$'`\"")))
      (message "%s" cmd)
        (let ((res (shell-command-to-string cmd)))
           (message "%s" (concat cmd "\n" res))
        )
    )    
 )
)

// (global-set-key "\C-xm" 'find-mentions)
