Stuff I should be able to get rid of:

 - ines.cpp "trainerpoo"
 - file wrappers
 - new ppu?
 - auto-fire
 - movie recording
 - Got rid of a lot of LUA, but still:
      grep LUA `find . -type f`
 - movie.*
 - video.cc can probably go?
 - archives

Surprisingly necessary:
 - crc32 since ines.cc has a table of games and their CRCs.
 - cart md5ing
 - md5 in FECUGI; note I'm using md5 for RamChecksum though
    - If this gets threaded to cartinfo, we also need it
      for example for hack checks in onebus.cc


Possible performance improvements:
 - Can the ZNTable be replaced with a computation on the value itself?
   See my comment in x6502.cc.
 
 - Is it possible to remove the indirection when reading/writing memory,
   perhaps in a special case? Currently ARead is populated with a bunch
   of function pointers (including special regions installed by various
   mappers and cart types.)
