(* The implementation of the dynamics engine has several complex,
   mutually-referential data structures. This defines the raw storage
   for these (body, fixture, world, contact, and joint) in a transparent
   way, as well as accessors for them. These are then used to implement
   the algorithms and abstract types in BDDWorld. This way we don't need
   the entire implementation in one file. Clients should not bother with
   this file. You can't even use it to get at the internals of dynamics
   types, because in the client interface those types are abstract.
