(* Represents imperative sparse n-Markov chains. This older version is
   implemented using splay trees and is less efficient (both in time
   and memory), though it is simpler to instantiate because it only
   requires an ordering function on symbols. If the set of symbols is
   small and dense, consider using the array-based version in
   nmarkov-sig.sml which is much more efficient. *)

     observed after the end symbol. This function takes a string,
     observes its first symbol after a state of N 'begin' symbols,
     then its second symbol after a state of N-1 'begin' symbols and
     the first symbol of the string, etc. It observes the end symbol
     once, with the length-n tail of the string (or padded with
     'begin' symbols if shorter than n) as the preceding state. The
     same weight is used for each observation. *)

  (* Produces a stream of the most probable observations ending with a
     certain symbol. The expected way for this to be used is for the
     symbol to be the end symbol sentinel, and the start state to be n
     copies of begin_symbol, following the convention of
     observe_weighted_string. In that case the result is a stream
     (infinite if there are any loops, which is typical) of words,
     ordered from most to least probable, along with their
     probabilities in (0, 1]. The end symbol is not included in the
     list, since it is usually a sentinel and would be included in
     any path anyway.

     If the n-Markov chain contains a cycle where every transition is
     probability 1, then the stream may loop forever without returning
     an answer. This will never be the case if the n-Markov chain was
     constructed only by calls to observe_weighted_string.
