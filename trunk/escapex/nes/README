    Escape for NES                15 Dec 2004


This is a port of Escape to the Nintendo Entertainment System. (Yes,
the 8-bit console from the 1980s!) It was made by Adam Goode for his
NES development course.

To build, Adam tells me that you get nesasm, and simply run it on
escape.asm. Some of the graphics and data are built by various opaque
perl scripts that are included in the source, but even Adam doesn't
remember how to run those.

Fortunately, the ROM file is available, so you don't need to compile
it yourself. Just load it up in your favorite emulator (or flash
cartridge), and play!



The NES port worked with all features of Escape (on levels 18x10 or
smaller) as of Summer 2004. However, newer versions of Escape have a
better compression algorithm for levels (which Escape for NES won't
support), and new tiles. So, Escape for NES should be seen as an
experimental fork rather than a supported alternate platform. ;)
