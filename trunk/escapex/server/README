 Escape Server Code                        10 May 2004


 The Escape server  is a set of database-driven  web scripts. They are
 written in  Aphasia 2 (http://aphasia.sourceforge.net/),  which is an
 advanced  functional scripting  language  for the  web, developed  by
 myself. Aphasia  2 is  a lot nicer  than the first  Aphasia prototype
 (for instance, anyone familiar with  SML will at least understand the
 syntax  and most  of the  type system),  but it  still has  a  lot of
 pre-requisites for installation, and is still a highly volatile piece
 of software.


 The  server  maintains  the   database  of  levels,  users,  ratings,
 comments, etc.  In general there  is one script  for each of  the RPC
 actions  that   can  be  performed.   There  are  also  a   bunch  of
 administrative scripts, that allow me to move and delete levels.

 There's not really  any point in other people  running Escape servers
 (in fact  I prefer to keep  a centralized repository  of all levels),
 but the  code is here  in case anyone  wants to. It is  also licensed
 under the GPL.
