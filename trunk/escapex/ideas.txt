Here's how the online stuff should work.



When playing a level, and especially upon completing it, the player
should be given the chance to rate the puzzle and leave comments.
These go via a web form to a database. We need personal UIDs in
order for this to work.


Intially a puzzle should be submitted to a "free-for-all" collection,
for which there is no editorial oversight. Authors need to be able
to retract a puzzle and replace it with a newer version. Solvers
need to be able to upload solutions to show alternate solutions.
