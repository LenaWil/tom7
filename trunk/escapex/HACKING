 ** Compiling Escape **

Note: If you don't want to install the sound libraries, you can
compile with -DNOSOUND to disable it. There's no sound yet, so
this might be a good idea.


To compile on Windows:

Although there are project files for Visual Studio, these often get
out of date. The main way to compile is using GNU 'make'.

Get the development library for SDL (libsdl.org), the VC6 one. I am
using version 1.2.6. Put that in a directory parallel to this one,
called "SDL-1.2.6". Right inside that directory should be the "lib",
"include" dirs, etc.

Get SDL_image from libsdl.org as well, I use
SDL_image-devel-1.2.4-VC6. Unzip this in another parallel directory
called "SDL_image-1.2.4" (so that "lib", "include", etc. are in that
dir.) For image, you also need to download the source zip
(SDL_image-1.2.4.zip). Inside that there is a VisualC.zip, which, in
its graphics subdirectory, contains an include and lib dir. Put the
contents of those in the SDL_image include and lib dirs. (We need the
png headers and libraries so that we can save pngs).

Do the same for SDL_net and SDL_mixer. I use versions
SDL_net-devel-1.2.5-VC6 and SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.6-VC6.


Copy all of the DLL files (jpeg.dll libpng13.dll zlib1.dll
SDL_image.dll from sdl_image, SDL_net.dll from sdl_net, sdl.dll from
SDL, **XXX MIXER ONES**) into the escapex dir.

If you don't have the same versions as me, you'll need to change the
names in the makefile.

You probably also need cygwin installed, or some other unix clone
that provides make, rm, and cp.

Run vcvars32.bat, which is your VC98 binaries dir. This puts the
compiler tools in your path.

Type make. 



To compile on Linux (RedHat):

Get SDL, SDL_image, SDL_net, and SDL_mixer (versions from above) as
RPMs (both libs and devel), and install. You may need to install
libogg and libvorbis (http://www.vorbis.com/download_unix.psp) for
SDL_mixer and libpng for SDL_image.


Type (if you are using bash):

export LINUX=true
make

This same procedure should work on other linux distributions as well.
Note that there are two modes of building: static and dynamic. If you
have difficulty at link time, then try:

export DYNAMIC=true
make clean
make




To compile on OSX:

You should be able to just type (in bash):

export OSX=true
make framelinks
make

.. since the library binaries ("Frameworks") are checked into the
repository and included in the source distribution. However, some
people have reported problems, which I can't debug due to a lack of
access to Macs (I build on Sourceforge's OSX 10.2 shell server). If
you have any ideas, please let me know.



Escape should run on any platform where SDL, SDL_net, SDL_image, and
SDL_mixer work. I am interested in ports to other architectures and
operating systems, so let me know if you can assist.

 ** Outstanding Issues **

To build the generated animation headers, you must use the packpng
program. This is only part of the makefile for windows, but it should
be straightforward to make it work on other platforms, provided that
the png headers are available. However, the headers and packed animation
graphic are checked into the repository, so it is not necessary to build
them unless you modify the animations.

I have had difficulty running packpng when compiled with VS.NET, perhaps
because of the incompatibilities with libpng's setjmp use. I would love
to debug this, but I have made no progress. Tips?


 ** Understanding the code **

There is no design document yet, because there are several things
that I expect to change. Basically, start in main.cpp and follow
things from there...

See the document protocol.txt for an explanation of the network
update features.

Here are some quirks to my C++ style, that might be good to know:


I don't use exceptions, because they are typically unportable, affect
performance throughout the code, and their semantics are inscrutible.
Therefore I usually don't use constructors and destructors, because
there is no way for a constructor to "fail" in C++ aside from
exceptions.

Instead, there are create() and destroy() methods for every class.
create() is static and will return 0 on failure.

"auto" scope is sometimes useful when there are many exits from a
block. However, it is inflexible because you cannot return the address
of an auto object. The "extent" template creates an auto object that
will destroy some other object (by calling its destroy method) when it
goes out of scope. However, the target object can be "released" so
that its address may be returned. In extent.h there are also templates
for extents on objects that use destructors and arrays of objects that
use destructors.

Because what I really want are SML's signatures and structures, I
treat header files like signatures and cpp files like structures. For
instance, http.h describes an abstract interface by only specifying
virtual functions and a static constructor, and the actual
implementation in http.cpp creates a class called httpreal, deriving
from http so that it can hide all the implementation details -- not
just by using 'private,' but, you really don't need to see them at all
in the header.

When programming this way, gcc gives some really confusing error
messages. For instance, if you have a function that is not implemented
by the deriving class, you will get a bunch of missing vtable errors,
talking about not-in-charge-this and in-charge-that. Very weird. On
the other hand, it makes it much easier to manage the code once you get
it to compile. ;)

Because what I really want is Java's interfaces, I may use multiple
inheritance. But at most one (and probably none) of the parent classes
will be ever be concrete.

  ** Things to know **

  * Fonts *

The characters in the font are fixed width, but are drawn with
an overlap. If AB is drawn, then the first column of pixels in B
will be drawn over the last column of pixels in A. For multi-character
glyphs (ie, the long checkmark), you'll want to account for this. See
the font graphic for an example. One non-obvious consequence is that
even if you simply duplicate the last column of pixels in the next
character, alpha-transparent pixels will be drawn twice, doubling
their opacity.

The characters are all defined in chars.h. Always use this instead
of giving color and glyph codes directly.
