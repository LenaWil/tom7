/* note: include level.h, not this. */

/* Defines the types of animation events that can
   occur. These are returned by level::move_animate
   if animation is enabled. */

/* as a result of a move, a list of animation events
   (avent) will be returned. Each event describes
   something that happened in a level (ie, a block
   was pushed from one square to another, a series
   of tiles were flipped from 'up' state to 'down,' 
   or the player was shot by a laser). The 
   responsibility for how these events should be 
   portrayed lies in whatever interprets the event
   list. In this sense animation also includes
   sound effects.
   
   Events have time stamps, given as serial numbers.
   Events with the same serial number happen at the
   same time. The event list should always be sorted
   with earlier serial numbers at the beginning of
   the list, and the numbers have no particular
   significance outside of ordering the list. 

   For each kind of event, there is an atag (tag_event),
   a structure describing the kind of data it contains
   (event_t) and a field in the aevent union (event).
