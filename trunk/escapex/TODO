* Current Projects

Use mingw to compile instead of CL on windows.

Use sdlutil and font from cc-lib.

64 bits?

Should be easy:
"Please consider writing and installing an AppData file with the
application description and some screenshots, else Escape looks really
bad in the GNOME and KDE Software Centers. We'd love to showcase more
applications, but without the extra data file we can't. See
http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/ for details; thanks!"


I think I introduced a regression in the behavior of wires from Radiant's "Global Thermonuclear War"

put optipng on all build machines
http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=optipng&filename=optipng-0.5.4-exe.zip&use_mirror=umn

* Binary linux distribution apparently includes uncleaned mylevels directory, which is weird

** Ability to store data within the executable itself
*** e.g. levels for tutorial, levels and sols for benchmark, regression suite?
*** then need ability to load PNGs (etc.) from static data in memory...
*** (all data for multiuser install)

** EscapeMark
  Need benchmark for testing speed gains between e.g. PPC and Universal Binary on MacBook. (?)

* Server
** Limit the number of levels that a non-trusted user can upload in one day.

* Linux port
** dependency on libgdk 1.2 (apparently not on many systems)--can ship it.

** Remotes
*** Computer = DES? MD5?
*** duh, don't need to repeat animation frames that are identical

** Levels in progress/todo:
*** FRA (frankfurt)
*** MCI (kansas city)
*** LHR (London Heathrow)
*** PIT (Pittsburgh) - in progress, good
*** HEL (Helsinki)
*** TKU (Turku)
*** PHL (Philadelphia International Airport)
*** NCE (Nice)
*** PDX (Portland)
*** ...

** Fix levels
*** Skirting the Issue (cooked by max)
*** Splitsville (cooked by everyone)

** Web Page
*** user guide
*** screenshots!
**** new level screenshots (new player!)
**** some screenshot with animation (BETA3)
**** New level browser screenshot
**** bots
*** buttons / banners for links    (BETA3?)
**** walking escapist

** New level browser based on tags, not dirs
*** should support agglomeration from many locations
    so that we can do multi-user installs (a la mergefs)
*** should support "escape database" files so that
    we needn't touch so many files just to look through
    triage
*** should probably be multi-threaded so that we don't
    have to wait until every solution is checked

** level notes.
   grand prix: first blue to the left (stop at ud slider),
   then blue down, send red left then up.

** Upgrade System (BETA3)
*** important! 
   we can now fetch files that belong in ..
   by putting them in the web dir with @.
   but the build system needs to be updated to
   deal with this (on OSX).

*** prevent upgrade when user-compiled on linux

** Animation
*** why doesn't wave go all at once in max's "Wave"?
  because: although two non-interfering animations can
  be played within the same serial, we don't organize
  several independent two-serial events to run in parallel.
*** make things snappier/smoother
**** holding down key should work
**** move while animation is playing?
  (rather than cancel, as we currently do,
   maybe we could just add the animations
   into the queue?)
  some animations could fly around in the
  background while the player continues
  to move. a generic disambiguation system
  would be perfect for this..
**** try to make it so that if the player
    will move in some phase, that the
    movement phase is first. this gives
    more snappy-feeling movement (see
    max's chamber, my favorite test case)
*** make yellow slide lr more like ud
*** speed pref?
*** turn on/off anim in level?
**** now easy with the menu at top
*** don't slam exit door -- have closedoor event
*** test scrolling                 (BETA3)
*** frames_error[] for defaults    (BETA3)
*** player                         (BETA3)
**** player winning (graphic exists in graphics/guy_happy.psd)
**** player pushing udlr           (BETA3?)
  should lean over, so hands are actually
  up against the block!
**** player 'pressing'
  could be same as push anim (still) for now
**** player 'kicking'
  could be same as press anim for now
**** teleporting off-screen
**** laser death
***** could be improved (laser flicks off?)
***** improve: laser from below can go to chest
*** traps
**** improve trap2 -> trap1
*** wires animation
**** swaps triggered by button push (and remotes) aren't delayed
     like the wire anims are.
**** anim for button
**** weird discontinuity with overlapping wires triggered by
     the same button (correct, but not slick). Probably two
     overlapping wire pulses should just happen serially.
*** stepping on panel?
*** replace jiggle with individual anims for
    each sphere, including the last one when
    it doesn't move
*** bugs:
*** bot on panel dying (see kacper's bot collision bug)
*** yorder comparison is not stable.
    the pointer comparison is useless because
    the pointers change during animation (?)
*** panel (un)triggered when stepping into a
    teleporter doesn't animate!
*** jiggle animation can be wrong (see animation.cc)
*** push a series of steel blocks off the 
    screen; the last one does not move, it
    just gets overwritten by the one before it
*** stepping onto an exit that is disappearing
    (because we're stepping off a panel) still
    draws the door open anim
    .. this is not really semantically wrong,
    but the two actions should be in different
    phases, at least.

** Sound                                 (BETA3)
*** use ogg instead of wav?
*** option on/off
*** way to prevent the same sound from being
    played multiple times in the same moment
**** adding sounds
***** player walks
****** onto panel
***** robot walks
***** laser death
***** robot crash
***** object zapped
***** enter exit
***** block pushed
***** sphere flying
***** sphere hits
***** break block
***** exit wakes
***** get heartframer
***** push button
***** trap falls
***** grey into hole
***** bomb explodes
***** ...


** Bookmarks
*** option: delete bookmarks when level is solved?
*** show bookmark "ghost racers"??
     (probably wouldn't make much sense unless you could
      see ghosts for the rest of the board's contents,
      but that wouldn't be too hard.)

** Usability
*** Installer
**** prompt to run when done installing
**** choose directory allow typing
*** File browser: rename files
*** Handhold
**** suggest register (when?)
**** suggest tutorial (when any remains)
*** When saving in editor: Overwrite file? y/N
*** Pie charts for ratings instead of bar widths?

** net stuff??
*** register player
**** now we do care about cryptographic randomness
**** probably better to use passwords so a player can share
      logins across multiple machines
*** viewing comments
**** from game
*** sync ratings automatically, perhaps when updating.
    (should set a flag to say that some ratings have
     been unsent -- or could do this rating by rating)

** Code cleanup and modernization
*** gcc 4.0 warnings
*** vc++ warnings
*** triage xxx/fixme/perf
*** split up deeply nested code
*** move.h bad tabification
**** main.cc
***** this shouldn't all be in main, anyway
**** load.cc !!
**** edit.cc !
*** abstract interfaces (as in http.h) where possible
**** edit.h
**** level.h ?
**** play.h (still needs cleanup)
*** rationalize treatment of SDL_QUIT message
*** get rid of msg in upgrade/update. it is redundant.

** Bugs

*** When a level can't be downloaded from the server, all updating stops,
    and it reports success (2959 bug)?
*** Solution management (defaults, automatic saving when beating a level, downloads, 
    bookmarks vs. solutions, etc.) is pretty messed up. Write a real spec for 
    addsolution, implement it, and use it.
*** Should use unicode symbols for keys always, so that
    people get consistent game/menu behavior (pieguy in dvorak)
*** when showing botnums, a detonated bomb's number sticks around
*** Timer prefab: bot at bottom will walk up if player
    is above him vertically. 
*** CRASH: if there are no levels at all, right after saying
    "there are no levels at all!"
*** CRASH: apparently possible to overflow the event buffer (or something) 
    while animation is going on; we only interrupt on keypress. 
    This can totally happen when the mouse is moved during a long
    animation. To test: load a level with long animations (in solution
    playback), and then move the mouse quickly while pressing keys
    randomly.
*** CRASH: randstyle 7 on blank level
*** view doesn't show bot numbers when zoomed out.
*** editor doesn't show msg when zoomed out. This is bad, especially
    in "choose destination" mode
*** CRASH on ToF? v2 when pushing grey blocks (can't reproduce, valgrinds ok)
*** start game. don't move mouse. (or put it above the topmost
    level on load screen) go to load screen, scroll down and sit there
    for a while level jumps up by 6 or so!! (BETA3?!) (is this just my
    mouse on metroid? it only happens there.) (it happens with lolo
    too, which is a touchpad!) SDL is totally sending periodic mm
    events when the mouse is NOT being touched. (enable printing in
    selector.h to see) what's the deal?
*** OSX has different menu selected color, because of byte order
*** packpng does not run when compiled with VS.NET (on laptop)
*** win32: makefile doesn't stop if packpng returns -1
*** valgrind warns on closedir: "mutex is still in use" (??)
*** Load
**** hit esc from a directory two levels deep. now re-enter load
    screen and go to .. --- it sends you straight to the root.
*** LIBPNG has security holes and should be upgraded on platforms where
    it is shipped. Escape doesn't load untrusted pngs, but one day we
    may support a skin system, at which point this would become
    potentially exploitable.

    Unfortunately, word has it that SDL_Image uses an ancient libpng
    API, so we may be screwed.
*** hit 1 to load. remove one of the directories from the command line. 
    try to change to it. now, you won't be able to change to anything
    because the path will be screwed up.

    ie:
    where: './attic-old/attic-old/fixme/fixme/official/triage/triage/attic-old'

*** textbox: extra word wrapping 
    this is a longer line\n
    shorterline
    where line + shorterline is too long to fit
*** leaks
**** editing
      .. some leaks in retract
*** pass allow_corrupted to dircache too (it doesn't count them now)
*** warning: unsigned/signed comparison in util
*** valgrind: randstyle illegal read (see editai)
   this mode is currently disabled, and it sucks anyway...
*** edit allows load over changed level
   though we warn for most other actions that destroy an unsaved level

** Hidden info
*** toggle display of bots/bombs (or make them translucent. noname's trick)
*** show bomb timer nums
*** exploded move (animate with no dab)

** Hardening
*** automatically back up player file 
**** recover player should let you pick from a list
*** make a pass over with 
**** deleted/corrupted files
**** no disk space / read-only drive
  From first start, we can't do anything because
  there is no default.esp and we can't make it.
  Also, SDL tries to create files, at least on win32,
  before we even get control.
**** interrupted network connection
**** really long inputs
**** totally empty root dir (no .. entry)

** Perf
*** 2.6 gigs of allocation?
    I think that some of the retraction stuff must be very allocation-heavy.
    Playing with it just a little results in 2.6 gigs of allocation!!! (which
    is ultimately freed...)

    Actually I saw this without doing retraction (only a few hundred megs in
    that case). String stuff?
==12334==
==12334== ERROR SUMMARY: 279 errors from 4 contexts (suppressed: 185 from 4)
==12334== malloc/free: in use at exit: 2154726 bytes in 451 blocks.
==12334== malloc/free: 4546124 allocs, 4545673 frees, 2649989249 bytes allocated.

*** more aggressive caching for dirs? (like what?)
*** load performance
   With the progress indicator, this becomes much less painful!

   We now cache solutions, but this doesn't help much.

   After profiling (with levels in cache disk), we learn that
   the time is indeed spent loading and verifying the levels.
   The right thing to do here is to not be recursive, and maybe
   even to delay doing stuff like solution checking until we
   need to actually display them on the screen.

   On windows, there seems to be a lot of disk thrashing on the
   first launch (until the files get in cache)...


Tucows has a very old version; update:
http://tucows.com/preview/383408

** Little nice things
*** when a non-empty checkpoint exists, draw tiny version in top-right
*** improve look of textbox
*** progress indicator when updating levels. The first user experience
    is bad here.
*** solution/bookmark recovery: see edit.cc.
    should keep a list of candidate "old" md5s to check for solutions + bookmarks
    (could just run solution recovery like ctrl_0)
*** autosave edited levels
*** when losing a comment, at least copy it to the clipboard. ugh.
*** when uploading, rename the solution within the player file to "Original"
    if it is untitled
*** when uploading, explain what kinds of things should be uploaded
   **** no boring levels (autodetect?)
*** escape.spacebar.org link on title screen
*** if escape is started through a symlink (linux), it should
    find its 'real' location. (It may fail to find libs this way, btw)
*** when setting destination after scrolling, it doesn't show the
    destination temporarily, as it does if you don't scroll.
*** improve general mainmenu icon color scheme
*** playback of solution while rating/commenting
*** Mainshow
**** make the levels more interesting
    .. load some from triage?
**** Neal suggests "Pac-Man" like cast movie
*** sad face for when reporting errors (like, "your comment was lost")
*** show nsolved ncooked (in sideinfo)
    not sure if this is a good idea
*** "you solved it" centered wrt level, not screen?
*** scrolling arrows centered wrt drawing, not level
*** way to minimize app with keystroke
*** player selector
**** show player details at bottom, like on load screen?
***** might want to save more info, then


** Graphics
*** QICON kind of sucks
*** THINSPACE, NEGSPACE and other 'magic' formatting characters
*** hand anti-alias the font
*** implement 'color stack' for fonts 
**** font::closestack
  .. adds and removes pops to make parens balanced.

** "messages" in escape levels
  Is this really a good idea? It's quite fun to try to express
  things merely using the stuff in the game.
*** prompts (waits keypress)
*** status line
*** 'hint' flag with 'hinting' mode

** editor fanciness
*** random styles and random generator
**** 'pattern' matching system
**** overwrite yes/no
**** retract1
*** undo
*** drag off edge causes line to edge, at least

** player file size

-rw-r--r--    1 tom7     users       33669 Jun 23 19:54 tom.esp (sub-byte encodings)
*** in rleencode, write smaller frame headers
    rledecode already supports this.
*** improve solution optimization
    (look for shorter paths between level-changing events)
    it seems that some of the reachability stuff should
    make this pretty easy. 

    even simpler, just replay the solutions, and if we ever reach
    the same x/y location twice, try deleting the series
    of moves in-between, and re-validating the solution.

    multi-solution optimization
*** prune solutions in player files 
   (ie, restrict to files actually on disk!!)
   ... tom's is growing pretty big now.


** Little nice things
*** init_flips still seems wrong. Pitched
    rectangle doesn't have height h (TILEH)
    in its center!
*** zooming
    make tileu buttons for it
*** center the drawing (horizontally, at least) 
    when I can't fit all tiles. 
    (also when I can ?!)
*** draw alpha-dimmed tiles around border?
     (tilesdim is now there.)
**** draw it!

** Fancy graphics
*** hq2x version for very high resolutions?
*** meld adjacent blue blocks, etc.
   this will interfere badly with animation, so it's
   probably not worth it.
*** select source dir for game graphics ("skins")
**** useful to have 'color blind' option (turns anims off,
                                          probably)
*** select other player graphics
*** tile backgrounds
   should be purely graphical (not affecting gameplay)
   esp 'exit' in like, choochu shuba
   (use 'dest' to find background tile? -- no, that's
    messy. just use a new layer, like:)
*** variations layer
   another layer with variations for the tiles (mainly
   static items like floor, exit, walls, black). I think
   this is superior to the "tile background" hack above

** Build system
*** after make upgrade on windows, md5.obj is messed
*** make recommend (etc.)

** new tiles
*** fire tile that spreads fire to (flammable) adjacent tiles at some rate
    (say every 4 turns), turning it into burned ash, kills player
*** mirrors for beams, should be easy except for
    animation.
*** one-way tiles (a la lolo)

*** more bots
**** move in a certain direction
    (then we want 'direction' tiles to change the robot's direction)
**** 'don medusa' moving laser
**** sleeping bombs? (don't ignite when pushed, last heart framer
     ignites them)
**** "nervous bots" that are hugbots that fall asleep (with timer)
     whenever you touch them @n7dot

*** powers that can be picked up
**** bridge, a la lolo
    (crosses what, water?)
**** zapper: when pressing against a block that
     can't be moved, vaporize it (use once)
     .. shouldn't apply to blue; we need a nice-looking
     invincible block
     .. actually, should match bombability
**** key?
     different colors, and they unlock specific doors
**** radiant's "colored footsteps" that color the player
     and allow him to push colored panels down. I'd draw
     it as colored balloons.

*** brian's 4-way POOF! block
    .. needs generic disembodied 'push' routine
    - good if triggered by wires?
*** 4x4 rotator. when pressed, it rotates its target
    4x4 squares clockwise.
*** warp to bizarro world??
*** tile creator 
    (if to its left/right/whatever, there is floor and no
     guy, create a block. maybe this would work better as
     a single tile that creates blocks on itself)
    (could be triggered by a button?)
    (could copy whatever is to its right, etc.?)
*** max's "spring" block (player springs out like gold block)
*** "heart framers" and friends:
**** lolo "treasure" (kills all bots)
***** sleeping "treasure"
*** "jelly" that you pull by "swimming" through it:
       _GJ_  -- move right -->    _JG_
*** water: player can swim through it, bots avoid (except
    daleks, who jump in and kill themselves) ?

*** minotaur
*** "bomb squad" robot that is controlled by push buttons
*** more stuff controlled by wires and buttons (ie panels)
**** panel-like flipper that is activated by pulse; pretty easy.
**** robot that can be controlled by pushbuttonss
      probably bad for these to be controlled by wires, because
      then we could do two in the same push, which would lead to
      ambiguity because there are no diagonal motions. We could
      still have two pushes in the same TURN (one by player, one
      by bot), but those have unambiguous order and we could either
      do them all or just do the last or first one.
**** blaster that destroys certain tiles (bombable) horizontally
     when it receives a pulse.. 
     - also an ordering problem, but here we could at least just 
     trigger all blasters simultaneously at the end of the motion.
**** "floor sensor" or whatever 

** web browser integration?
*** can put <img src="http://localhost:34883/blah"> in pages ...

** "Known Issues"
*** switching color depths while escape is running breaks things
*** can't do multi-user installations on non-linux platforms yet. just have each
    user install for himself
*** alt-tabbing leaves the alt key held (press it again when returning)
*** It is possible to crash the game by overflowing the event buffer
    during long calculations or animation. (You have to try, though..)
    This seems to be an SDL problem, but some defensive coding could
    probably eliminate it.
