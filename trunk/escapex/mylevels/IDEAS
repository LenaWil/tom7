PHX: a series of horizontal columns that you cannot pass without
destroying the bot; killing each one gives you an additional
"inventory" item.

  - need to use dalek to make broken bot, to temporarily
	block bot #2
	(but can I get the broken bot off that one later?
         yes)


Vague idea: a grid of independent cells that, when solved, release
a sphere of some color into a different cell; puzzle is to figure
out the order in which to solve the cells(?)

   #    to    #

With remotes: "langoliers" is two levels at once, "out of phase"
              with one another

Level with a grid of transponders that look like
they check that all blocks are cleared, but there's actually an
error in the grid so that's not necessary.

The Right Way?

Have a level where the solution is to only move to
the right. (transporters, etc.)


False Dichotomy.


Have a situation like this:

#########
#o       G
#         #
#        o#
###########

it should not be possible to press both panels.

shooting the gold block at either one of the choices
ultimately results in a non-solution, even though
they are both tantalizing, and both together would
form a solution. (Instead the player must do something
else, like not push the gold block at all, or push it
upwards)
