[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 264.9 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 9.1222 seconds.
 (98.66 mega-iters/s)

** Get rid of needless braces:

[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 264.7 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 9.1478 seconds.
 (98.38 mega-iters/s)

(maybe slightly-faster compilation, obviously no performance
 difference unless compiler is garbage)

** SOME fallthroughs:

[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 535.5 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 18.1603 seconds.
 (49.56 mega-iters/s)

!?

** It gets worse, the more fallthrough we have...

OK!
[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 705.0 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 24.6082 seconds.
 (36.57 mega-iters/s)

 - Might be inhibiting optimizations since compilation time goes way up
 - The iter branches might be somehow more expensive than we thought?

** Without "return" (separate inexact / exact pass) it's much better again

[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 570.0 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 9.0126 seconds.
 (99.86 mega-iters/s)

.. even slightly faster than the original!

** Start killing dead assignments to instruction pointer:

[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 522.3 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 9.0360 seconds.
 (99.60 mega-iters/s)

** Same I think, refactoring

OK!
[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 522.8 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 9.0258 seconds.
 (99.71 mega-iters/s)

** More dead-write analysis

OK!
[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 518.3 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 8.9943 seconds.
 (100.06 mega-iters/s)

** Dead analysis for all opcodes:

[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 517.4 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 8.8543 seconds.
 (101.65 mega-iters/s)


** Fixed bug with deadness:

[GPU] Program generation/compilation took 511.9 ms.
[GPU] Ran 9000 problems for 100000 iterations in 8.8698 seconds.
 (101.47 mega-iters/s)
