neighborhoods.kml -   KML file containing Pittsburgh's neighborhoods
                      as polygons. Based on the PDF maps from the
                      Pittsburgh map room and believed to be public
                      domain. Not yet complete.

                      The maps are fairly accurate (borders closely
                      track landmarks like roads, rivers, and train
                      tracks when possible). Curves are approximated
                      with line segments. Borders that go through
                      wooded areas (etc.) are eyeballed as well as I
                      could from the PDFs, which themselves appear to
                      be eyeballed. The quality varies depending on
                      the characteristics of the neighborhood.
                      Shadyside is probably accurate within a few
                      dozen square feet, whereas Hays is almost
                      completely guesswork.

                      Currently in this file (because it is in
                      progress) the points do not coincide exactly,
                      but makepoints.sml shows how to normalize this
                      with the sml-lib polygon library. A future
                      version of this kml will probably have them
                      normalized by default.

To build everything you need to install rsvg-convert in the
subdirectory rsvg (not checked in), or modify the makefile. For
installing on Windows, I used these instructions:
