        Embroidery                                 13 Jun 2010

This directory contains applications for working with machine
embroidery files (mainly those compatible with the Singer Futura
line). It uses sml-lib's implementation of those file formats
and SVG to convert between them so that the embroidery files
can be edited in sensible graphics programs.
