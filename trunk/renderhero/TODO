These are notes for my synth/tracker I'd like to write, since this is
the closest thing to code for that.

idea: options automatically render chords in stereo space

effect based on very low-bitrate MP3

noise pitch? (with lowpass/highpass?) (already did this in t7eshero)

too many simultaneous noise notes sounds very bad
