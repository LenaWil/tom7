(* Power-Hour sampling approach. Unlike the code in powerhour.sml, we
   are not trying to enumerate all possible power hours. Instead, we
   are trying to explore the space (e.g. randomly) to establish that
   certain possibilities are possible. The expectation is that for
   very powerful BMnL games (e.g. 100 cup states) and small
   possibility radixes (e.g. 2 players in 60 minutes) that we'd
   efficiently establish the existence of games covering the
   entire matrix. Of course, p players in BM8L can achieve any
   result (because one player can), so this is mostly useful
   when p is small but the number of cup states is < 8. Specifically,
   we hope to either show that BM6L or BM7L covers the grid for
   two-player games, tightening that bound.

   Because of this use, it's not critical that we can generate
   all possible legal games, nor that we do so uniformly. We also don't
   care about shots wasted, prefering to just optimize for throughput.
