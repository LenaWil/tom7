cc-lib                             Tom 7       8 Jul 2012

Like my much more impressive "sml-lib", this is my attempt to get
all of my frequently used C++ libraries into a single place so that
different copies don't accumulate different changes.

I try to use portable style where possible to make compiling against
this easy. I hate complicated makefiles, actually basically all build
systems, library dependencies, autoconf, and that stuff. But ultimately
it's kind of complicated, you know?


A lot of what's here is google "base" libraries, since those are quite
useful and I know them well. They have been released multiple times
underopen-source licenses; particularly the Apache 2.0 license, which
is in APACHE20.

Currently, everything else is licensed under the GPL, which can be
found in COPYING.
