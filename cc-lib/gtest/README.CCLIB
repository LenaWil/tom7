This is Google's testing package, stripped of all the stuff I don't
want and made compatible with cc-lib style. It was actually really
painless to do this; thanks googletest maintainers!

To use it, just #include "gtest/gtest.h" and build/link gtest-all.cc.

https://code.google.com/p/googletest/ is the original home.

I didn't make many modifications, except to move everything into this
directory, and delete some junk, and replace references to "src/" with
"gest/" in various #includes.
