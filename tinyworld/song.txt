
By pressing Y,
you'll be in my world
called T in Y world

and it's a very tiny world
if you ask me


But you can make
your own adventure
by pressing enter
and maybe it should be called
XYZZT


the instructions are in the game
the contest theme is in the name
so just sing along and hide your shame
and advance frame


T in Y World   -- I prefer
coffee, my girl    and refer
to the 
deadline
it's not
enough time
