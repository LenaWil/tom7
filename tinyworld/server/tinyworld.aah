(* This is the server backend code for T in Y World, my Ludum Dare #23
   entry. There's not really any user-facing web stuff here. It is
   basically just a simple blob storage so that the game's levels can
   be edited from the flash app.

   This software is written in Aphasia 2, which is a type-safe functional
   web scripting language I made. You probably don't want to try to
   install this, but maybe the code is understandable. It's a bit like
   Standard ML with built-in databases. *)
