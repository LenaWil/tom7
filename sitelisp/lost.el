;; a periodic (once a second?) timer should:
;;; - update the modeline with the current timeout.
;;; - if the timeout is less than 4 minutes:
;;;    - insist that the buffer *swan* exists
;;;     - (if it doesn't, make it with a prompt)
;;;    - insist that it is displayed
;;;    - if it has the correct numbers entered, then
;;;      erase it and reset the count
;;; - beep every few seconds with increasing annoyance
