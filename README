The program lambdac compiles Lambda 5 on Rails code to client side
Javascript and server-side bytecode. Its lineage is complex:
    mtex -> hemlock -> aphasia2 -> humlock -> lambdac.

Hemlock is documented in "ML Grid Programming in ConCert" by Tom
Murphy VII in the SIGPLAN ML Workshop 2006. Humlock is described in
the 2006 Tech Report "The Cult of the Bound Variable: The 9th Annual
ICFP Programming Contest" (CMU-CS-06-163) and documented briefly in
the corresponding source release (http://boundvarible.org/).

Currently the CPS representation in the middle-end is engineered for
correctness, not speed. This means that it does O(n^2) or worse
traversals of the abstract syntax for some phases. Thus the compiler
is limited to medium-sized examples for the time being. It should not
be difficult to reimplement the CPS structure with de Bruijn indices
or explicit substitutions to gain orders of magnitude better
performance.
