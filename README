The program lambdac compiles Lambda 5 on Rails code to client side
Javascript and server-side bytecode. Its lineage is complex:
    mtex -> hemlock -> aphasia2 -> humlock -> lambdac.

Hemlock is documented in "ML Grid Programming in ConCert" by
Tom Murphy VII in the SIGPLAN ML Workshop 2006. Documentation for
Humlock will be available soon.

Right now it is a partially rewritten gutted version of Humlock, so
don't surprised that the compiler always fails.
