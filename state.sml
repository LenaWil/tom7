     update for one axis. When we move we increment dancedist by the
     length of the vector. The configured axes are guaranteed to be
     dense and small, starting from zero, so we use a growarray. 

     One problem(?) with this is that guitars with more axes have an easier
     time achieving dance distance, since they have more dimensions in which
     to move. (But how many can they really have??) There are lots of other
     things that can make a guitar easier for dancing, like more sensitive
     accelerometers. What we really need is some kind of calibration step,
     but one that doesn't let you cheat...

     Actually I decided there's no point in measuring this in N-dimensional
     space, but to just do Manhattan distance. Also starting at 0 is silly
     since the accelerometers are usually centered in normal positions. *)
