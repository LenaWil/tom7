    Power Hour                                 23 Dec 2013

This is an attempt to do exhaustive exploration of power hour state
machines, as described in the paper at SIGBOVIK 2012 (an April Fool's
Day conference, just to set the right context :)), "Algorithms for
k/n Power Hours."

The subdirectory contains a follow-up paper (as yet unfinished and
unpublished) describing these techniques and their results.
