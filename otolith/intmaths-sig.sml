  (* Checks for illegal triangle overlap.

     Returns true if the pair of triangles overlap.
     This includes the case where any vertex is inside
     the other triangle. It allows the two triangles
     to share a vertex or edge. It allows a vertex to
     be exactly upon an edge of another triangle, but
     only on one side (consistent with the pointinside
     test). Usually you don't want this anyway. (XXX
     consider disallowing this case -- in a tesselation,
     every point should be in at most one triangle,
     right?)

     XXX This does not yet handle the case where
     two triangles intersect but neither has a point
     inside the other, like in the Star of David. I
     think that's sufficient for tesselation checks
     because there's no way to construct the Star of
     David without violating this function momentarily.

     The function should be fixed and callers should
     be ready for that. *)
