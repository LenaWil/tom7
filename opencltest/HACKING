How I installed this junk:

Got the "AMD APP SDK":

http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/heterogeneous-computing/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/downloads/

I installed it in

d:\amdsdk\

I installed everything but the ARAPI (java) stuff.

The samples in AMD APP SDK\2.9\samples\bolt\bin\x86_64 ran okay (command-line).

FUN FACT! Even though I chose to install in d:\amdsdk, it still put most of the good stuff
in c:\program files (x86)\amd app sdk\. This is where the opencl includes and libraries are.
It was actually pretty straightforward after that though. Just add like

AMD_ARCH=x86_64
AMDSDK="/c/Program Files (x86)/AMD APP SDK/2.9"

CLINCLUDES=-I ${AMDSDK}/include
CLLIBS=-L ${AMDSDK}/lib/${AMD_ARCH}

then $(CLINCLUDES) as an arg to mingw when compiling
and $(CLLIBS) -lOpenCL when linking.
