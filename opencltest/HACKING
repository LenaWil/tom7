How I installed this junk:

Got the "AMD APP SDK":

http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/heterogeneous-computing/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/downloads/

I installed it in

d:\amdsdk\

I installed everything but the ARAPI (java) stuff.

The samples in AMD APP SDK\2.9\samples\bolt\bin\x86_64 ran okay (command-line).

FUN FACT! Even though I chose to install in d:\amdsdk, it still put most of the good stuff
in c:\program files (x86)\amd app sdk\. This is where the opencl includes and libraries are.
It was actually pretty straightforward after that though. Just add like

AMD_ARCH=x86_64
AMDSDK="/c/Program Files (x86)/AMD APP SDK/2.9"

CLINCLUDES=-I ${AMDSDK}/include
CLLIBS=-L ${AMDSDK}/lib/${AMD_ARCH}

then $(CLINCLUDES) as an arg to mingw when compiling
and $(CLLIBS) -lOpenCL when linking.


n.b. it's important that kernels finish pretty quickly. If not, you
get chunky behavior of the screen (which makes using the computer
terrible), but also if it takes more than 5 seconds, Windows will kill
the display driver because it thinks it's crashed.
I could run 3000 simultaneous simulations in codebench, each a million
iterations, and this was ok. Anyway, it seems it's possible to increase the
display driver crash timeout:

though I don't understand that page.
