Title theme song:
  It's dangerous to go      alone
  but you got another paw   to hold
  Maybe we better not?
  but we gotta catch that dot!
  and it's dangerous to go alone...

  It's dangerous to go     outside
  adventurous              implied

  It's dangerous to leave  the house
  Adventurous enough   to chase   a mouse

  shivering  in the abyss
  I'm glad I took my sis!

  cuz it's dangerous to go alone!
