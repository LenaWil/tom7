
I stoped using Visual Studio! I hate it! Good riddance!

Now this compiles with MinGW, which finally in 2014 is getting pretty
good. I installed it through Cygwin. Specifically, I installed Cygwin64,
and installed the packages called x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ and so on.
You know you've succeeded when this command

x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++.exe --version

Prints version 4.8.2 or later. (I use C++11 features in here so you
actually do need a newish version of gcc. It's worth it.) Don't even
bother installing the other kinds of mingw; they compile for dead-ass
architectures. They're just there to trap you. The makefile invokes
the right one directly, assuming it's in your path.

This program needs SDL, which goes in the subdirectory called SDL.
Then you gotta build it (with the same mingw compiler); the makefile
links it statically instead of dealing with shared library stuff. That
should also mean that the .exe it produces doesn't rely on SDL DLLs.
It does compile against libz and libpng, also linking those statically.
I think I got them through the same cygwin install. Since these are
only used so that we can one day save PNG files (and why?), I should
just replace this with the STB library that has built-in hermetic
PNG saving support.



Threads: Yikes! Still figuring this out. I modified SDL to use
-pthread, including modifying SDL_config to set the define, instead of
win32 threads. Newest mingw-64 supposedly has support.
