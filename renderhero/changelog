    * renderhero.sml: Forked T7EShero to make an off-line version for
      sample-accurate rendering of chiptune midi.

	* sdl.sml: Fixed the values of the sdlk datatype. Everything should
	  work now. Added an sdlktos function that was useful during debugging
	  and might be useful to clients too.

	* jumptest.sml: Fixed clipping on the feet. Basically works now.
