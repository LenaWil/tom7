             occurred between lt and now. This is the case when the delta time
             is less than now - lt.

             There may be many such events, each measured as a delta from the
             previous one. For example, we might have

                            now = 17

              left to emit the 'gap'; this begins as now - lt = 7.

              We then emit any events with delta time less than the gap,
              reducing the gap as we do so. (We can think of this as also
              updating lt, but there is no reason for that.)
