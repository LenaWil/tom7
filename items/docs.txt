
Items are like this:

RedGuitar | guitar | Red Guitar | guitar1.png |0|77| guitar2.png |0|77| guitar3.png |0|77| guitar4.png |0|77|   5

... where the first field is the unique canonical name for it (just
letters and numbers please). The second field identifies a group of
mutually-exclusive items (e.g., so that the robot will not have two
wigs on at the same time) and is freeform. The third field is a
freeform description of the item for in-game display. It may include
color codes. Then there are four triplets of filename and x/y offset,
for the four frames of the robot animation. (Note that the frames will
ping-pong.) Finally, the z-index indicates the order in which items
will be drawn. Numbers closer to negative infinity are drawn first.
The robot is drawn at 0, which is an illegal z-index for an item. Ties
are broken by lexicographic ordering on the canonical name.


It is helpful to have some kind of consistency to z-indices so that we
can figure out where an item should go without looking at all of the
other items. Here is a rough plan:


(no real plan for negative stuff yet)

things that are basically changing the robot's body (colors): 2
things that adorn the metal directly (tattoos): 4
wearables that go under underwear (naughty, fishnet): 6
underwear: 8
shoes: 10
pants (since we usually want shirts to hang over pants): 12
t-shirts, polos: 14
over-shirts (sweaters, button-down): 16
jackets: 18
tops items worn over jackets (life preserver): 20
items worn around the waist (floaty tube): 22

items carried in the hands (guitar): 30
