(* This is a body editor for a new game, codename TOWARD.

   It allows (or will, when it's workin'?) to build a collection of
   bodies, each of which is a collection of fixtures (low-vertex
   convex polygons) in fixed relative positions. It probably needs
   to associate some kind of graphic with the body (which is just
   for the physics simulation), but that will have to wait for
   GL support.
