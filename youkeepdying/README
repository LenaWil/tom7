You Keep Dying                        Tom 7     6 Mar 2010


This is my project for SIGBOVIK 2010. It's a somewhat unusual platform
game. (As of 6 Mar 2010, totally unfinished and in that sense quite
usual :))

Unfortunately it cannot be edited without Macromedia Flash. However,
the source code and graphics may be redistributed under the terms of
the GNU Public License (see COPYING).



Like my unfinished "adventuregame" project, this uses Flash as both
the graphics editor and assembler and the game data editor. Visible in
the editor are control objects in each scene; these have some
influence on the game but hide themselves from the player upon
loading. Their properties are set in the editor, like:

// This example from adventuregame
onClipEvent(load) {
	this.doorname = "tokitchen";
	this.frametarget = "kitchen";
	this.doortarget = "toinside";
	this.dir = 2;
}

The support code is in the corresponding .as file.



Assumptions:

 - The aspect ratio of a door determines whether it is a horizontal
   or vertical door. For vertical (tall) doors, the player's y position
   is preserved and x position is set to that of the destination door's 
   registration mark (typically the door's center). The player is then
   moved upward to make sure he is not inside any floor. To establish
   this invariant, the destination registration mark may never be inside
   the clip region!



 - Every room must have exactly one spawn point.
