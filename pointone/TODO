 - clipping by growing blocks
 - behavior for each point

WOULD HELP A LOT:
 - break blocks in the middle usually
 - player animation top-down
 - background changes by point
 - pushing certain bricks
 - pulse/timeout for making new blocks
 - in "think" mode, can also rearrange points

POLISH:
 - more sounds
 - outside corners of air
 - smooth falling on falling/shrinking block
 - timing between songs
 - 'extend' version of points
 - arrow to indicate current pt
 - physics polish
 - falling 1x1 bricks should never draw as 1x1
 - instructions screen

points:
