This is Tom 7's attempt to make FCE Ultra into a thread-safe library.
As of 14 Jun 2015, what's here is the modernization I did for the
Learnfun & Playfun project (../tasbot/) and major culling of
unnecessary parts of FCEU. I've also transformed many of the modules
into objects so that they don't read and write global variables, but
there's some more of that to do. After that's done, it should be a
single heroic pass to make the emulator instantiatable multiple times
in the same process.

The new interface is in emulator.h and emulator_test contains a small
test suite to make sure I don't mess anything up as I transform the
code.
