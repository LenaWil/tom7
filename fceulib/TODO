Stuff I should be able to get rid of:

 - I've been compiling with -g instead of -O3 for quite a while.
   Do a comprehensive test to make sure it's okay!

 - ines.cpp "trainerpoo"
 - file wrappers can be massively simplified
 - file archive support
 - auto-fire
 - proper in-memory treatment of battery backed saves. lots of
   red herrings here! also, it leaks file descriptors.
 - autosave (fceu.cc mostly)
 - get rid of _defines in x6502.cc
 - FCEUI_Initialize calls srand -- what is using random numbers?
 - NSF code in mapper.h and the uncalled functions therein?

      Still to objectify:

      emulator.cc
      fceu.cc
      state.cc
      input/*
      boards/*
      mappers/*

      A little left over in:
      ines.cc

Memory todo:
 - Need to check that various objects are actually having their Free or Kill
   methods called, or roll those into the destructores, etc.

Cleanup to do:
 - There are some symbols that are both #defined (e.g. ines.h) and
   declared, maybe with #undef before like in mmc3.cc. So confusing!
 - clang format?

Surprisingly necessary:
 - crc32 since ines.cc has a table of games and their CRCs.
 - cart md5ing
 - md5 in FECUGI; note I'm using md5 for RamChecksum though
    - If this gets threaded to cartinfo, we also need it
      for example for hack checks in onebus.cc


Possible performance improvements:
 - Can the ZNTable be replaced with a computation on the value itself?
   See my comment in x6502.cc.

 - ppulut2 is just a bit shift of ppulut1; bette for cache to just
   compute it?
 
 - Is it possible to remove the indirection when reading/writing memory,
   perhaps in a special case? Currently ARead is populated with a bunch
   of function pointers (including special regions installed by various
   mappers and cart types.) Could maybe be replaced with a single function
   (inlined into x6502) per mapper configuration.


Notes:
"CDLogger" is "code data logger", and I have deemed it unnecessary

Helper snippets:

# alias files='find . -type f | grep -v .svn | grep -v ".o$"'
alias files="/bin/find . -type f | grep -v roms/ | grep -v roms_crash/ | grep -v .svn | grep -v '.nes$' | grep -v '.exe$' | grep -v '.o$'"
(defun find-mentions () 
 (interactive "")
 (let ((sym (thing-at-point 'symbol)))
    (message sym)
    (let ((cmd (concat "bash -c \"grep '"
	                sym 
	   	        "' `/bin/find . -type f | grep -v roms/ | grep -v roms_crash/ | grep -v .svn | grep -v '.nes$' | grep -v '.exe$' | grep -v '.o$'`\"")))
      (message "%s" cmd)
        (let ((res (shell-command-to-string cmd)))
           (message "%s" (concat cmd "\n" res))
        )
    )    
 )
)

// (global-set-key "\C-xm" 'find-mentions)

(defun insert-ppu ()
