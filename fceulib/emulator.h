  Library interface to FCEUX. This is an attempt to proper encapsulation
  of the emulator so that there can be multiple instances at once and
  they can run in separate threads, but I haven't succeded at that yet;
  if you create multiple instances of this object they will trample on
  each other and cause undefined behavior.
