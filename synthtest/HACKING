
You need Visual Studio 2010, SDL and SDL_image to build this.
Visual studio can be installed anywhere. Then you need to run

vcvarsall amd64

to configure the compiler for 64 bits.

SDL and SDL_image go in subdirectories of this one. You just need the
include/ and lib/ files from the "devel" editions (for "VC",
definitely not mingw). Then put the x64 windows libraries (DLLs) in
this current directory (these are currently checked in).
