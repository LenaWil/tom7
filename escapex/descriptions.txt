Escape is a tile-based puzzle game in the style of "Adventures of Lolo" or "Chip's Challenge." Unlike either of those games, Escape doesn't rely at all on reflexes--it's all about your brain.

Although Escape comes with hundreds of levels, the game places an emphasis on the composition of new puzzles. Thus Escape has a built-in level editor and facilities for automatically sharing puzzles with other players.

The game is played on a grid in wich the player must manipulate blocks, lasers, switches, and other devices in order to reach the exit. Of course, this is more easily said than done!

For Chip's Challenge players
----------------------------------
Hey guys. I was a big fan of Chip's Challenge back in 90s. In fact, I
made my own puzzle game "Escape" that's quite similar (but of course
it has many differences, new ideas, and all new levels, or what would
be the point?) that I think you guys might like, too.

It's totally free and runs on most computers. It's hooked into the
internet so that people can compete for speed records, and upload
their level creations instantly.
