2010-11-26  Tom 7  <Tom@WARPZONE>

        * load.cc: Improved the interface for ctrl-0 (from the loader)
          and made it possible to just run it on a single level.

2010-01-18  Tom 7  <Tom@WARPZONE>

        * upper.cc: Made the upgrade process more robust (thanks adam!)

2009-12-24  Tom 7  <twm@...>

        * level.cc: Check more corner cases when loading levels, to
          protect against particularly subversive authors. (Thanks
          radiant!)

2009-12-20  Tom 7  <Tom@WARPZONE>

        * animation.cc: Finally added teleport animation for both the
          player and daleks.

        * server/upload.aa: Instituted a limit to the number of levels
          that can be uploaded in a 24-hour period.

2009-12-19  Tom 7  <Tom@WARPZONE>

        * play.cc: Fixed bug with menu display while playing, which could
          show spurious move counters and play/pause buttons, especially
          on very wide monitors.

        * makefile: Switched to mingw on Windows, switched to Subversion,
          and modernized file naming conventions. Don't search .svn
          directories for escape files.

2009-01-04  Tom 7  <Tom@WARPZONE>

        * animation.cpp: Fixed a somewhat serious bug with the animation
          of bombs that could nondeterministically cause trap animations
          to be drawn as well. Made animation drawing a little more
          persnickety so that these kinds of things show up less rarely
          if they exist. (Thanks, gary and noname).

2008-11-09  Tom 7  <Tom@WARPZONE>

        * move.h: Fixed a bug when animating wires. 

2007-04-28  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * level.cpp: Fixed two ways that escape could crash
          on corrupted level files (Thanks, Adam).

2007-04-12  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: ctrl-middle click in the editor now swaps
          a tile with its bizarro counterpart.

2007-04-12  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * move.h: Fixed an animation bug introduced in the
          wire animation rewrite.

        * makefile: The OSX version is now a universal binary
          (Intel/PPC) and uses symlinks instead of copies 
          internally (smaller zip).

2007-04-08  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * move.h: Fixed a bug introduced when adding animations
          while teleporting.

2007-04-05  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * util.cpp: Linux: upgrade and update can now delete files
          when Escape is running from AFS.
        * startup.cpp: Escape now supports multi-user installations
          on linux (packages forthcoming). This disables in-game
          upgrade, so the single user install is preferable if
          feasible. Multi-user installs for other platforms coming
          soon.

2007-02-06  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * update.cpp: Show more progress when updating the levels
          from the internet.

2007-02-04  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: The superuser can delete any level from
          within the game now.

2007-01-23  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * player.cpp: Always prefer an actual solution to a
          bookmark (this cures some "invalid solution" problems
          when automatically uploading speedruns).

2007-01-22  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * move.h: There is still no animation for teleporting,
          but now other animations will play when teleporting
          (panel swaps, bot deaths, etc.)

        * draw.cpp: Randomized the colors of the lines when
          drawing panel destinations. (Not sure if this will
          stay yet.) ctrl-d also enables random perturbation
          of the lines so that overlapping ones are easier to
          see; try holding it down.

2007-01-11  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * util.h: To prevent loss of solutions, always
          save solutions after playing.

2006-12-17  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * upgrade.cpp: Fixed a bug that prevented the game
          from being able to upgrade on OS X ("Could not
          unlink for symlink.")

        * edit.cpp: Changed the order that tiles appear in
          the editor menu, to better group them by function.
          (Rather than the order in which they were added to
          the game!)

2006-11-30  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * editprefab.cpp: Added a rudimentary cut-and-paste
          facility in the form of a prefab that inserts
          another level into the selected region.

2006-11-28  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * play.cpp: While playing, pressing enter to restart
          no longer zooms in.

2006-11-26  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        ### NEW TILE ###
        
        * level.h: Added remotes. These are panels that are
          activated (only) by wires. Like panels, they have
          a single destination and swap that destination's
          tile with the bizarro world at that location. Unlike
          lights, remotes "pass through" a pulse of electricity
          like cross-over wires, so that a button press can
          now have more than four effects.

2006-11-26  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * move.h: Improved the order of animations with wires
          and transponders.

2006-11-12  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * main.cpp (main): Removed the mouse warp when the
          game starts.

        * play.cpp: Added playback ability and fast-undo and
          fast-redo commands to the play menu. This means that
          all of the functionality of the solution manager is
          now available from the bookmarks system while playing.
          Moreover, you can do all of the normal things like
          zoom in and out and scroll while the solution is playing.

2006-11-11  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * play.cpp: Displayed the keys that are available in
          the bookmarks menu.

2006-11-09  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp: Fixed a long-standing bug with bookmarks,
          where one could load a solution and then move off of
          the exit (or, in pathological cases, out of the path
          of a laser). Eventually this could lead to crashes.
          Death and exiting are now handled in a much more
          uniform way, so the menu and any sensible keys can
          be used even after the level is won or player is dead.

2006-11-09  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * optimize.cpp: The secret key ctrl-0 while playing now
          attempts to complete the level using the bookmarks
          that you have for that level. This is mainly useful
          when you've already solved it but want to shorten your
          solution (for speed-running) by changing something that
          you did early in the level.

2006-11-08  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * play.cpp: Added the ability to redo while playing.
          The same mechanism can be used to step through
          a solution in 'play' mode, but then diverge to create
          a different solution. Added <home> (same as 'r') and
          <end> keys to go to the beginning and end of the solution.
        
2006-10-15  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp: Added the ability to optimize solutions from
          the bookmarks menu ('o' key).

        * play.cpp: Add download button to the bookmarks menu
          in the continuing deprecation of the solution manager.

2006-10-15  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * menu.cpp: Add gratuitous gradient effect to menus to
          make it look like I did something.

2006-09-27  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * play.cpp: Can now upload a solution from the
          bookmarks menu. Press 'u'. (This will be clearer soon.)

2006-08-25  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * makefile: Upgraded to SDL 1.2.11, which fixes a number
          of bugs, including the window size issue on Windows
          using the XP theme, and the weird transparency on some
          compositing window managers for Linux.

2006-06-26  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: Fixed a minor bug where canceling a panel
          or teleporter destination while editing the bizarro
          world would undo to the contents of the regular world.
        
2006-06-19  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * server/autothin.aa: Added a new collection, "minor
          leagues," which is automatically populated with
          levels from triage that have a difficulty and style
          rating of less than 30.0 and 25.0, have at least 5
          votes, and have been in triage for at least 5 days.

2006-06-19  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * play.cpp: Improved internationalization by detecting
          keys according to their unicode values, rather than
          keyboard symbols. (Thanks, wowei.)

2006-06-13  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * menu.cpp: Fixed many bugs with the way long menus
          (ones that don't fit on one screen) are displayed.
          Improved the display of the bookmarks menu as well.

        * play.cpp: Can now delete bookmarks from the bookmarks
          menu ('del' key).

2006-06-12  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * play.cpp: Can now set the default solution from
          the bookmarks menu ('insert' key).

        * load.cpp: Improved progress indicator when using
          ctrl-0 to recover solutions.

2006-06-10  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * play.cpp: Added "restart" icon when playing.

2006-06-09  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * play.cpp: Allowed renaming of bookmarks (press F2 on
          a bookmark); more options coming soon.

2006-06-08  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * prompt.cpp: Changed prompts to use the menu system.

        * textbox.cpp: Improved the appearance of the text input
          box.

2006-05-28  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * makefile: Enabled compiler optimizations on Windows, which
          should improve performance substantially.

2006-05-13  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * menu.cpp: Draw checkboxes using checks instead of the
          letter x.

        * menu.cpp: Made it possible to move menus by clicking on 
          and dragging the bar at the top.

2006-03-10  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp: There is a new key in the ongoing battle against
          hidden information. While playing, 'n' now toggles display 
          of bot numbers.

2006-03-09  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * draw.cpp: The 'd' key in the editor and game now shows
          destinations for tiles in both layers.

2006-02-24  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * winmain.cpp: Saving from the editor can now sometimes
          recover bookmarks in addition to solutions from old versions
          of the level. The circumstances under which this can happen
          should be expanded, however. 

2006-02-24  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * edit.cpp: Fixed a dataloss bug where the player file would
          be corrupted when trying to bookmark a level while editing
          it.

2006-02-01  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * play.cpp: New "cheat" while playing: press 'd' to see the
          destination for every panel.

2006-01-27  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp: Stored bookmarks no longer prevent the rating
          screen from opening the first time you solve a level.

2005-12-12  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * playerdb.cpp: It is now possible to delete players from the
          player selection menu again. They are actually moved to the
          'attic' directory rather than being deleted outright.

2005-12-03  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * editai.cpp: Fix crash when running 'random' on a level less
          than three tiles wide or tall.

2005-12-02  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * font.cpp: Fixed an old bug in font drawing; the color/alpha
          stack was not working correctly at all.

2005-11-27  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * registration.cpp: Display the error message from the server
          when registration fails.

2005-11-22  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * animation.cpp: Added a progress bar on the "loading" splash,
          too.

2005-11-21  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * dircache.cpp: Approximately doubled performance when loading in
          directories of levels. This comes at a welcome time, I'm sure,
          since it was getting pretty slow with the mammoth triage
          collection.

        * load.cpp: Added a progress bar for solution recovery.

        * load.cpp: Fixed a crashing bug when there were no levels
          installed at all.

2005-11-03  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * smanage.cpp: Fixed a bug introduced in the last version
          where new records could not be marked as speedruns!

2005-11-01  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * smanage.cpp: Added a warning when uploading a solution that
          is not marked as a speedrun, since some people seem to be
          doing this by accident.

2005-10-28  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * smanage.cpp: Fixed a bug where deleting solutions in the
          solution manager could lead it to believe that some correct
          solutions didn't verify.

2005-10-12  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Smoothed the animation for pushing blocks and
          bombs.

        * smanage.cpp: Improved the display of bookmarks when managing
          solutions.

2005-10-08  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        ### NEW TILE ###

        * edit.cpp: Added bombs, by popular request. Bombs are kinds of
          bots. When unlit, they behave like broken bots (that is, they do
          nothing). Bombs become lit when pushed by the player or bots.
          When a bomb is pushed (even if it has already been lit), the
          fuse is reset to a number between 0 and 10 (the level author can
          modify this value for each bomb.)

          Bombs always "move" after regular bots. On their "motion", lit
          fuses count down. If the fuse expires, then the bomb explodes.
          An exploding bomb destroys adjacent bots, and also causes other
          bombs to explode immediately. It also destroys certain tiles,
          turning them into floor. At the end of the turn, if the player
          is standing adjacent or atop a square where a bomb exploded, he
          dies.

        * level.h: Increased the maximum number of bots to 15. I hope
          you guys have learned enough restraint to not just make 
          hugbot pushfests with this.

2005-09-26  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: When saving an untitled level, derive a temporary
          title from the filename.

        * load.cpp: Added messages when trying to do server operations
          if not registered.

2005-09-19  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * playerdb.cpp: The game no longer keeps a database of player files;
          any players in the escape directory are automatically found. So to
          import, just copy a player into the directory.

        * play.cpp: Bookmarks work now, but it is inconvenient to manage
          them (must use the solution manager), and they are in some
          places confused with actual solutions. They are also deleted
          when (for instance) you solve the level. I will fix these things
          soon.

2005-09-11  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp: Improved display of level while playing, and added
          play menu. Bookmarks are not yet implemented, but that is next!

2005-08-23  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * message.cpp: It is now possible to activate message boxes
          (OK/Cancel) with the mouse.

        * edit.cpp: Clearing the level now removes all bots as well.

2005-08-14  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: Erase the status message when cancelling a "getdest"
          (when placing a bot or teleport destination, etc.)

2005-08-08  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * editprefab.cpp: Added a "prefab" system to the editor with one
          prefab: bot-based timers. Select an area, hit 'i', then give a
          number of moves, and the game will place a timer that expires
          after that many moves. This can be on the far left or far right
          of the level. If the area is too big or the number too large,
          you may have to wait a long time, so be careful! (improvements
          soon. suggestions welcome, as well as suggestions for more
          prefabs...)

2005-08-06  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: Improved the drawing of the toolbar in the editor;
          tools that are senseless because of the current state of the
          level are drawn disabled. Now showing that 'n' makes broken
          bots.

2005-07-31  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * smanage.cpp: Now drawing a red line through solutions that
          don't verify in the solution manager.

        * load.cpp: Now, if you have solutions that verify and solutions
          that don't, it will automatically make one of the verifying
          ones the default. (Thanks, Adam.)

        * update.cpp: Fixed a bug where the directories would not get
          created when subscribing to a collection using the mouse.
          (Thanks, Adam.)

2005-07-28  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: I believe I fixed the old bug where double clicking
          a directory from the load screen could lead to a crash under
          unknown circumstances. This was done by adding further checks
          for things that shouldn't have been possible, so I appreciate
          feedback about whether this worked or not. (I can no longer
          reproduce the crash personally.)

2005-07-28  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * edit.cpp: Fixed resizing of the window when done while playing
          a level from the editor.

2005-07-26  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        ### RULE CHANGE ###
        * move.h: Made cross-over wires pushable, as I had intended.

        * smanage.cpp: Added fast-forward in solution playback, finally.

2005-07-23  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * server/comments.aa: Modified the display of comments so that
          a series of comments on the same level show up together.

        ### NEW TILE ###
        * level.h: Added transponders (a kind of wire that can beam
          through the air) and cross-over wires. Animations still have
          some problems.

2005-07-21  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * font.cpp: Fixed the use of ^ (usually indicating color codes)
          inside text entry boxes.

2005-07-20  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: The player always turns immediately when making a
          move, even if his movement is delayed to show some animation.

2005-07-18  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: In the editor, it now restores the old title if you
          click to change it but then cancel with escape.

2005-07-16  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: Fixed another animation bug (when pushing blocks) that
          was found by Max.

2005-07-15  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * animation.cpp: Fixed a bug where if a bot died on a tile, then
          any exit that ever appeared at that tile would appear open 
          during animation forever.

2005-07-02  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: Added a selection pattern extension tool. After making
          a selection, you can extend it in any of the four directions by
          pressing shift-arrow keys. It works like this: it detects a
          repeating pattern in your selection (if there is none, then the
          whole selection is the repeating pattern) and then adds another
          row or column onto the side that is being extended, in order to
          continue the pattern.
         
          This tool can also be used to make rows of panels with the same,
          or linearly changing destinations. To do this, you must have at
          least 2 occurrences of your pattern in the selection, since it
          will use the difference between the panel destinations in those
          two occurrences in order to figure out what to point new panels
          to. For very simple panel sequences, this should just do what
          you expect; for more complex ones, the panel destination display
          (activated with 'd') may make it more clear what is going on.

2005-06-29  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Added a secret sort mode, ctrl-e, which shows the levels
          ranked by the number of players that have solved them (and submitted
          ratings to the server). This is good for finding levels that have
          "slipped through the cracks"...

        * load.cpp: You can now supply a message when uploading a level.

2005-06-27  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * edit.cpp: Added a secret key in the editor (d) to toggle display
          of all panel and teleport destinations. 

2005-06-21  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: When canceling the placement of a panel or transporter,
          put back what was there instead of floor.

        * edit.cpp: Can now change bot type by just putting another bot
          on top of it.

        * smanage.cpp: Now showing the same ugly move counter in
          solution playback.

        * chars.h: Added glyphs for left and right arrows <- and ->,
          then replaced these in text where they occurred.

2005-06-20  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * load.cpp: When you delete from the server, you can now supply
          a message.

        * animation.cpp: Improved drawing of exit during animation. If
          an entity is on it, it will draw as open. This makes the fact
          that doors instantly slam shut more obvious, but that will be
          fixed later.

          ### RULE CHANGE ###
        * move.h: I fixed a more serious bug involving pushing robots
          over traps. This again had to do with the order of swapping, but
          has been seen in at least one real level (Jumps: Tom 7 variation).

          ### RULE CHANGE ###
          (from now on, I will mark changes to the basic rules like
           this. This won't include new tiles or bots.)

        * move.h: Fixed a very, very old bug with the way that traps and
          panels interacted. The problem was that trap "falling" was
          checked after panels when stepping off a tile, so if a trap was
          introduced under the player's feet from a panel swap as he was
          stepping off a tile, then that trap would fall. This contradicts
          the "law of physics" that panel swaps all happen at the very end
          of a motion. Without bots, this could only happen if the panel
          targeted itself, and so I don't think this situation occurs in
          any levels.
        
2005-06-14  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * edit.cpp: You can no longer scroll off the left and top edges
          of the map when setting a panel or teleport location.

        * edit.cpp: When scrolled, the coordinates of the top-left visible
          tile are shown.

        * draw.cpp: Improved the positioning of the scroll-indicator
          arrows.

        * play.cpp: Fixed a problem where stored solutions that didn't
          validate (these can only arise from other bugs, but they have
          existed in the past) could only be overwritten by shorter
          solutions, which could make some levels permanently
          "unsolvable." Everything should work in the expected way now.

        * player.cpp: Fixed a bug with solution backups, where if there
          was a file called (playername).esp.~s where itoa(atoi(s)) != s,
          then the program would loop forever trying to delete it.
          These files actually get created by CVS in some instances, though
          this was unlikely to affect anyone but Escape developers.

2005-06-10  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: Can now scroll the map manually while setting the
          destination of a teleport or panel, or placing a bot (use the
          arrow keys, just like when editing normally).

        * play.cpp: Can now scroll while playing, by using ctrl-arrow keys.

2005-06-07  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * draw.cpp: The zoom amount on the main menu is now controlled by
          the level size. At first, this was set to a maximum zoom of 3
          (one more than before), but I realized that this level of zoom
          makes most levels hard to see. So, the maximum zoom is set to 2,
          which is what it always was before. As a result, only a few tiny
          levels (smaller than 5x12 or so) get an extra zoom-in because of
          this change.

        * misc/: added some experimental code for generating levels by
          computer. This will be hard to use unless you are a programmer
          (and you will need an SML compiler to compile it), but it is
          at a point where it could be useful for some experts to generate
          sokoban levels (with <=6 blocks) or yellow sliding block puzzles
          (with <=5 blocks). Totally undocumented, for now.

2005-05-30  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: Added sleeping bots. These wake up when you get the last
          heart framer, just like the sleeping exit. Until then, you can
          push them around like broken bots. (So therefore, there is no
          sleeping version of the broken bot. It is already "sleeping with
          the fishes" anyway!)

        * edit.cpp: Now, the 'w' key toggles sleeping/awake for bots
          instead of switching the (rarely used) random style.
        
        * load.cpp: Use a nice key icon to indicate that you own a
          level.

2005-05-27  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * animation.cpp: Fixed a problem with death animations showing
          up below other animations (which was introduced in the latest
          version).

2005-05-26  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * load.cpp: Now shows if you are the one who uploaded a level. If
          you're the one who uploaded, you can delete levels from the
          server (moving them to the graveyard, so nothing is really lost)
          by pressing 'del' in triage. You can also now upload levels with
          the same title as another level, as long as that other level is
          in the graveyard. So, there is no requirement to put "v2" at the
          ends of levels, though this might be a good idea; it's up to
          you.

          Generally speaking, only delete a level if you are uploading a
          new version of it. We can deal with crummy or cookable levels in
          triage another way (though I've really been putting this off!).

2005-05-25  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Fixed bug where ctrl-n didn't sort by newness.

2005-05-21  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * draw.cpp: Improved drawing in a few subtle ways. Now bots
          and animations are always drawn from the top of the screen
          to the bottom, so their antennae always draw on "top" of 
          the bot behind them. Exit doors also stay open when a bot
          is on them.

        * move.h: Fixed a bug where players and bots were drawn twice
          while walking, which made their shadows doubly dark.

        * move.h: Fixed a long-standing, annoying bug with animation,
          where bots walking on a column of panels all targeting the same
          tile (a common idiom) would cause the bot to 'jump' back and
          forth.

2005-05-16  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: The sort order is now sticky over trips to the
          load screen.

        * util.cpp: Alphabetic sorting is now mostly case-insensitive.

        * load.cpp: The cursor now follows the selected file when you
          change sort orders.

2005-05-07  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Added sounds for lights and electricity turning
          off, but I'm not going to enable these in the release until there
          is substantially more event coverage.

2005-04-27  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * smanage.cpp: You can now resize the screen and close the program
          when solutions are being played back. (Thanks again Stephan.)
          Moving the mouse too much while a solution is being played could
          cause a crash. I will fix this soon.
        
2005-04-26  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: Fixed a bug with heart framers (similar to the problem
          in "The Dalek Question"); thanks Stephan.

2005-04-25  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Added a cute animation for when sleeping doors
          wake up. Also added a simple animation for when the player
          picks up heart framers.

2005-04-25  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * sdlutil.cpp: Fixed newly introduced bug on OSX (and other
          big-endian systems) where the colors of shrunken things were
          totally screwed up. This also fixes the long-standing (but
          less obvious) problem where the little movie on the main menu
          was yellowish instead of being transparentish. Thanks to
          William for laptop access.

2005-04-25  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: Corrected a small bug where a Dalek could erroneously
          step onto an electric tile that was already occupied.
          
        * move.h: Added heart framers and sleeping exits. These need
          animation badly. Sleeping bots soon, too.

2005-04-24  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * smanage.cpp: Hooked up fwd/rev/frev in solution playback.
          You can also use 'f' and 'u' as replacements for the arrow
          keys if you are bothered by the cognitive dissonance of 
          pressing one direction and having the player potentially 
          move in some other. Fast forward is coming soon.

2005-04-22  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp: You can now undo when you're dead or when you've
          won (can be useful for speedrunning) by pressing 'u' when
          the message box pops up.

        * move.h: Fixed hugbot redraw bug (see level) when pushing. 
          There's still at least one alarming hugbot drawing issue,
          but I think I might know how to fix it.

2005-04-21  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * smanage.cpp: The VCR now has real buttons and can show you
          what mode it's in, but only allows playing and pausing.

2005-04-15  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: The game is now more picky about what counts as
          a valid solution, requiring that the solution not only solve
          the level, but that there be no more moves after solving it.
          I fixed ctrl-0 (solution import) to behave better given this
          change.

        * smanage.cpp: You can now watch solutions from the solution
          manager, though the VCR buttons aren't hooked up yet and
          have placeholder graphics.

        * move.h: Fixed a bug where a dalek killing itself (by walking
          onto electricity) would not trigger the edge effect of the
          panel. (Thanks Max!)

2005-04-09  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * smanage.cpp: Restored the ability to manually optimize, now
          by pressing ctrl-o on a solution in the solution manager.

2005-04-05  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * load.cpp: There is a new format for index files, and these
          now store the date that a level was uploaded, as well as
          the current best speedrun length. These are shown in the
          level detail area. Additionally, there is a new sort method
          for directories; press ctrl-n to sort with newest levels first
          (this is also the default now!).

        * sdlutil.cpp: Did a more principled rewrite of the color
          averaging code for resizing images. (Thanks jcreed!) This
          results in significantly better quality on transparent
          images, like the player and (especially) bots. Updated
          the screenshots on the server.

2005-04-04  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * edit.cpp: Fixed the size of the selection rectangle
          when zoomed out.

        * sdlutil.cpp: Fixed a bug with the way odd-sized images
          were resized, which caused bots to lose their feet in
          screenshots. The shrinking of bots and players is still
          not entirely satisfactory, however.

2005-04-04  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: Fixed several bugs where players (and bots) could
          activate things with bots on them. Now this is no longer
          possible.

2005-03-29  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * smanage.cpp: Added the ability to store multiple
          solutions, and manage solutions. Press ctrl-m from
          the load screen to reach this. Also added a speedrun
          system on the server; if, when rating a level, you
          are found to have the shortest solution for it,
          then it will automatically prompt you to upload that
          solution. For now, be courteous and let the original
          authors of the levels claim speedruns for their own
          levels, if they want.

2005-03-29  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Removed ctrl-9 for solution optimization.
          This will move to the solution manager, which is
          available (but not currently very useful) with ctrl-m.

2005-03-21  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp: You can now zoom out while playing, using
          the square brackets '[' and ']', just like you can
          when editing. This disables animation, but helps on
          some of the gigantic levels (but ruins other levels
          that are based on not being able to see off the screen!).

2005-03-19  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp, upload.cpp: There is now a preference
          (set by default) to automatically optimize new
          solutions. Solutions are also optimized (regardless
          of the preference) before they are uploaded to the
          server.

2005-03-18  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * load.cpp: It is now possible to run a simple
          optimization routine on your solutions by
          pressing ctrl-9 from the load screen. This will
          cut out any pointless loops in the way you
          walk around (from indecision or panel testing,
          etc.) to find a more direct path. Eventually
          there will be a preference to do this automatically
          when you solve a level, and perhaps a bit more
          intelligence in the optimizer. (ie., It could find
          shorter paths between points on the map, even if 
          you don't have loops in your solution.)

2005-03-18  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: Fixed "first bot" command to be useful.
          Now it preserves the order of the remaining bots.
          Also fixed the behavior of placing bots so that
          it doesn't draw tiles underneath the bot, as it
          sometimes did before.

        * play.cpp: Added (provisional) move counter while
          playing.
        
2005-03-15  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * edit.cpp: Added selection rectangle. Drag from
          top left to bottom right with right mouse button
          held to select, then ctrl+arrows to move the
          selection. Stuff like cut'n'paste are coming soon.

2005-03-12  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Fixed the key shortcut system so that
          'c' and 'r' and 'u' (etc.) jump to levels that
          start with those letters. Also, 'backspace' now
          ascends to the parent directory at any time.

2005-03-11  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * escape.txt: Updated documentation to reflect
          new additions.

        * move.h: Fixing up bot animation, and finishing
          the implementation of the initial three robots:
          Daleks, Hugbots, and Broken bots.
          
        * Added tutorials for each of the three new robot
          types.

2005-03-07  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: I corrected several mistakes in the
          moving code. Now, in every case, panel actions
          are carried out at the end of a motion (a "turn",
          without bots present). This only affected a few
          very rare circumstances, but it did break two
          levels (and possibly some that I've never beaten,
          although the solutions that the authors uploaded
          still work). I will try to fix them as a courtesy.

2005-03-05  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * edit.cpp: Fixed performance problem when drawing
          on the alternate layer in the editor.

2005-03-04  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * edit.cpp: In the process of hammering out the
          semantics for bots, I've decided that the current
          behavior of panels (in "warning" scenarios) is
          the best choice in general. Therefore, this
          behavior is no longer impure. The warning has
          been disabled in the editor.

        * edit.cpp: Middle-mouse now acts as an "eyedropper"
          in the editor, allowing you to change the drawing
          tile without moving the mouse up to the tile menu.

2005-03-03  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * player.cpp: Now using a text file format for
          players. This makes slightly larger files,
          but they 'diff' much more easily for inclusion
          in CVS, etc. They can also be edited by hand
          in emergencies.

2005-03-01  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * play.cpp: Implemented undo--press 'u' when
          playing. It doesn't work if you die (for now),
          so watch out!

2005-02-28  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * The server now handles color codes correctly
          in level titles.

2005-02-26  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: Improved electric turn-off effect.

2005-02-24  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * util.cpp: Even more natural sorting on
          the load screen (ignores 'the',
          punctuation).

        * makefile: Fixed, we hope, the binary
          portability on linux. This was mainly
          Adam's doing.

2005-02-23  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * move.h: Finished the implementation of
          steel tiles, including three colored
          versions (like colored spheres). Added
          tutorial for it. The graphics may change
          in the future.

2005-02-21  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * move.h: Added 'steel' tile, which is to
          red blocks what spheres are to yellow.

2005-02-20  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * server: Server now agrees with the client
          about what constitutes a valid solution.
          This means the player can now start in
          the path of a laser but still survive.

2005-02-19  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Drawing "lasered" animation.
          Drawing "winning" animation correctly.

        * main.cpp: Added "loading..." splash screen.

2005-02-19  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * animation.cpp: Rudimentary death animation
          code in place, but need to draw a real
          animation for it.

2005-02-18  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * animation.cpp: Resolved long standing issue
          with the player drawing and multi-phase
          animation. There are no known corner cases 
          with this any longer. (Please report player
          duplication bugs or alpha darkening!)

2005-02-14  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Fixed zoomed out pictures of
          player.
          
        * animation.cpp: Added animation for walking
          upward.

        * main.cpp: Fixed (I think) mouse warping when 
          the program is launched, causing something
          other than the appropriate default to be
          selected on the player selector.

2005-02-13  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Animations for walking left
          and right. Now more consistent about how the
          player is drawn, too. (Aside from some obvious
          unimplemented stuff!)

        * play.cpp: Now the user can abort the playing
          animation by pressing another key. This makes
          levels like Max's "Chamber v2" playable again!

2005-01-31  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * animation.cpp: Animated the player walking
          downward. More soon.

        * menu.cpp: Reverted to the original (mistaken)
          color for the highlighted control.

2005-01-28  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: The player is now drawn on
          top of any other animation, which avoids some
          ugly interference.

2005-01-25  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * player.png: Working on a new, larger player
          graphic as part of animation. Not quite
          finished yet--there are graphical glitches
          and I need to work on the left-right graphic.
          Soon, animation frames for him!

2005-01-22  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * sdlutil.cpp: Vastly improved graphics
          performance (especially on Linux) thanks
          to Adam Goode's patch.

2005-01-21  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Animated the swapping of
          colored floor.

        * triage: Fixed SFO and Splitsville, which had
          serious cooks.

2005-01-20  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Added the final two directions
          for pushing the green block.

2005-01-20  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * animation.cpp: Player doesn't walk behind
          the green block any more when pushing it.

        * dirt.cpp: Fixed bug with animation when
          the screen is resized.

        * upgrade.cpp: Upgraded the upgrade system.
          Now it can remove files, as well as create
          symlinks on Linux and Mac OSX.

2005-01-18  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Improved animation of
          wires and lights. Lights now light up,
          and the animation is synchronized in
          such a way that I finally believe the
          'Wires 2' tutorial will be fairly
          transparent.

2005-01-17  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * animation.cpp: Added animations for wires
          and lights.

2005-01-15  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * mainmenu.cpp: Perhaps improved performance
          of main menu by turning off alpha blit of
          the (opaque) background. (Doesn't seem
          to make a big difference on linux, where
          the main menu is quite laggy.)

        * menu.cpp: The mouse can now move sliders
          (by clicking, not dragging yet), toggle
          toggle buttons, and click buttons on
          menus.

2005-01-13  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * prefs.cpp: Added a preference for animation
          speed. So far, this is ignored except in the
          case that animation is disabled entirely.

        * upgrade.cpp: When upgrading, escape can now
          create subdirectories. This will be needed
          soon.

2005-01-11  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * pattern.h: Fixed bug in pattern matcher that
          caused it to fail to compile on newer versions
          of GCC.

2005-01-10  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Added animation for traps
          falling into holes.

2005-01-09  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Animated the pressing of ON
          buttons, as well as 1 and 0 buttons.

2005-01-08  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Animated electric floor turning
          off.

2005-01-06  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * mainshow.cpp: Miniature game animations now
          draw the player facing in the direcion that
          he's moving.

2005-01-03  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * animation.cpp: Improved animation for spheres
          squishing against walls.

        * mainmenu.cpp: Now using the selector (with mouse
          action) for the main menu as well.
          
        * mainmenu.cpp: Added icons to the main menu,
          like the player database has.

        * main.cpp: Avoided the initial (fake) mouse
          motion when the application starts, so the
          application can still be controlled like before
          with they keyboard. (There still appears to be
          a problem with this, urgh!)

2005-01-02  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * selector.h: The mouse can now control selectors,
          which are used to choose the player and levels.

2005-01-01  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * play.cpp: Improved the smoothness of animation.

2004-12-30  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * move.h: Added really crummy animations for mass
          tile changes (same as swapping). Better ones soon.

        * animation.cpp: Added animation for pushing a grey
          block into a hole.

2004-12-29  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * animation.cpp: Overhauled animation system. Added
          animation for the player walking (sliding! there
          will be frames for him soon) and pushing blocks.

2004-12-21  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * animation.cpp: Added animation for swapped tiles
          (targets of panels), though this is a little rough.

2004-12-20  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * animation.cpp: Added animations for zapped tiles,
          breaking block, and jiggling of spheres as a 'push'
          passes through them.

2004-12-19  Tom 7  <Tom@LOLO>

        * textbox.cpp: Fixed crash in text box when using
          long words. (Thanks bpotetz!) Also fixed word wrap
          a little, though it still acts strange for long words. 

        * animation.cpp: Kicking a gold block or sphere now
          animates its trip and hit. Most of the work was in
          developing a general animation system, so soon there
          will be many more animations. Upgraded versions of
          SDL and SDL_image.

2004-12-09  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * load.cpp: Dim ratings if there are only a few votes
          for that level.

        * rating.cpp: When rating a level as cooked, Escape now
          automatically prompts you to comment on that level,
          describing your cook.

2004-12-07  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * load.cpp: When paused looking at a level on the load
          screen, escape will now play back your solution in the
          preview, if you have one saved. (Need to make this
          a preference.)

2004-12-06  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * mainmenu.cpp: Improved CPU usage on main menu.

2004-10-27  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * escape.nsi: Added installer (using NSIS) for windows.

2004-10-25  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * http.cpp: Made HTTP code tolerant of certain broken web
          proxies (that translate the case of Connection type
          headers).

2004-10-20  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * http.cpp: Added advanced option for debugging the network
          stuff. This will probably be disabled again soon.

        * draw.cpp: Now show full rating information in details on
          load (etc.) screen. This needs to be a little bit less
          prominent to avoid information overload.
        
2004-09-20  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * edit.cpp: Added text warning to accompany graphical one with
          self-targeting panels.

2004-09-13  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * update.cpp: Reordered the items on the update menu, so that
          you need only press 'enter' to update.

2004-09-02  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * menu.h: Fixed the failure to compile on Mandrake 10.0. The
          problem was due to the gnome headers #defining gettext (a
          terrible idea), which caused confusing syntax errors.

2004-09-01  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * update.cpp: For level update, changed the selection of the
          subscribed collections to use the much nicer 'menu' system
          (like the preferences).

        * Changed the application name to 'Escape' under OS X.

2004-08-31  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * menu.cpp: Improved the look of buttons on menus, and added
          a cancel button in addition to the confirmation button.

        * rating.cpp: Fixed a crash if Escape fails to connect during
          the rating process.

2004-08-27  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * dircache.cpp: Made the load screen appear twice as fast,
          since we were caching everything twice (!).

        * playerdb.cpp: Fixed bug where the menu for the player
          list wouldn't show up the first time the game was launched.

        * handhold.cpp: Added a "first time" startup message that tells
          you what to do when you first play. It also reminds you to
          upgrade or update every month or so.

        * util.cpp: Got rid of all debugging printouts to the 
          console, in preparation for Beta.

2004-08-23  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * mainshow.cpp: Made the show a little bit more interesting,
          but also faded it so that it doesn't distract from the
          actual point of the main menu.

2004-08-23  Tom 7  <tom7@HELIUM>

        * mainmenu.cpp: Added a little show to the main menu. This
          will get better looking!

2004-08-22  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * level.cpp: Simplified the rules: Death is only checked for
          *after* each move. This means that you can successfully
          survive if you start a level standing in the path of a
          laser. This is a bit graphically awkward, but is simpler
          to explain and implement than the old rules.

        * load.cpp: Show the name of the directory being loaded in
          the progress indicator. Empty directories (or any directory
          with a file called .escignore) don't show up in the load
          list any more unless they have indexes. This should speed
          up load times again.

        * update.cpp: Use a smaller font for update. Now do sanity
          checking of the file and directory names.
        
2004-08-17  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * mainmenu.cpp: Made another attempt at making the main menu
          background appear under more circumstances.

2004-08-14  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Fixed broken sorting on global ratings.

2004-08-12  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * playerdb.cpp: Menu items now show up on the player selector
          screen.

        * edit.cpp: Restored the menu, which was lost with the last
          changes!

2004-08-11  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * draw.cpp: Cleaned up the code for drawing the level preview from
          the load screen. Side effects are that it is now centered
          (when appropriate) and scrolled to the start position of the
          player; the player is also now actually drawn.

        * playerdb.cpp: Cleaned up selector code and player database code.
          Now the player selector shows the player graphic, which can
          currently only be the "office" graphic. More to come.

2004-08-10  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * mainmenu.cpp: Changed title graphic and added a new
          level, "Rotary Club."

2004-08-06  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * screenshot.cpp: Added the "screenshot" program on linux.
          The server now uses this to generate pictures of each
          level for browsing on the web!

2004-08-04  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * player.cpp: Player files are now automatically backed
          up every few days. There is a preference to turn this
          off from the main menu, though there is currently no
          way to recover backed-up player files!

2004-08-03  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * mainmenu.cpp: I fancied up the main menu. This won't be
          the final look for "Beta," but it's got more stuff than
          before.

2004-08-01  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * menu.cpp: Labels now appear on sliders, drawn in the new
          small font.

2004-07-30  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * load.cpp: Made the load progress indicator graphical.
        
        * escape.txt: Updated the documentation for the impending
          Beta release.

2004-07-30  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Added a rudimentary progress indicator for the
          load screen, which is slow when there are a lot of levels
          that haven't been cached by the OS yet.

          Added the ability to delete files from the load screen;
          press 'del'.

          Made all sorting routines on the load screen stable --
          this gets rid of quirky results when (for instance) sorting
          several times in a row by 'solved' or deleting a file when
          the sort was anything but alphabetical.
        
        * upper.cpp: Index files are no longer stuck in the attic
          when updating.

2004-07-26  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * textscroll.cpp: Having so many levels exhibited a bug in
          level update, which I fixed.

2004-07-23  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * I found another batch (I think the last) of old submitted
          levels, and added many of them.

2004-07-20  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * level.h: Fixed devious bug where moving after cloning
          a solution (which happens in various places) could lead
          to memory corruption or a crash.

2004-07-20  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Now we don't save the tutorial dir as the last
          dir visited every time you visit the main menu.

2004-07-19  Tom 7  <tom7@HELIUM>

        * level.cpp (resize): When resizing a level, destinations
          (of panels, transporters) are now preserved correctly.

        * mainmenu.cpp: The tutorial is now shown on the main menu;
          the first unsolved level appears at the top. You can turn
          this off from the preferences menu, but it is recommended
          that you leave it on so that you notice when new tutorial
          levels arrive (as they will when new tiles are added).

2004-07-03  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: The load screen should be a bit faster, since
          we only verify solutions once per launch of escape.
          
        * load.cpp: Made sorts "natural" so that "Tutorial 10"
          comes after "Tutorial 9" instead of "Tutorial 1".

2004-06-24  Tom 7  <tom7@HELIUM>

        * main.cpp (main): When solving a level for the first time
          (if certain conditions are met), you are now prompted to
          rate it. This can be turned off from the preferences menu.

2004-06-23  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * main.cpp (main): Fixed a bug that kept solutions from
          being saved when beating a level saved with any older or
          newer compressor.

        * level.cpp: Changed the way that levels and solutions are
          compressed to squeeze out a little more space. Although
          the new routines can load old files, old versions of
          escape won't be able to read files saved with versions
          from today on. Therefore, the level database has been
          set as requiring today's version or later.
          
          The next planned change to this encoding should be
          backwards compatible, unless I've made a mistake.

2004-06-22  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * commenting.cpp: You can now comment on levels, although
          there is no way for users to see those comments yet. (Soon!)

        * editai.cpp: added names and short descriptions of each
          random AI mode.

2004-06-10  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * editai.cpp: mode 7 now retracts gold block / sphere movement
          in a potentially useful way.

2004-06-09  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * pattern.h: fixed horrible bugs in retract1. AI mode '7' now
          places a little hole-greyblock pattern in such a way that the
          level remains solvable (if it was before). More to come soon...

2004-05-24  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Sort by author with ctrl-t.

        * edit.cpp: Implemented zooming in and out using brackets [ ],
          doubled the maximum area of a level to 2048. 

        * update.cpp: Index names of subdirectories now leave out
          an unsightly leading space.
        
2004-05-22  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * Found a whole bunch of crappy old levels, and imported some
          of them (only the ones that I've solved already...!)

2004-05-21  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Fixed crash (regression) when looking at a directory
          with levels in it but no index at all.

2004-05-19  Tom 7  <Tom@METROID>

        * load.cpp: Added different sorting styles. Press ? from the
          load menu to see them.

2004-05-18  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * Some old imported levels were corrupted (in a fairly harmless
          way), and I now do strict checking on loaded levels, which
          caused them to be rejected. I replaced them with new versions
          in the triage collection. To recover your solutions, press
          ctrl-0 on the load screen (for a directory where there are
          levels with missing solutions) and type the name of your
          player file, such as myname.esp.
        
        * Added view of ratings. These are updated from the
          server at level update time. The server is itself only
          intermittently updated. Personal ratings are not shown yet.

2004-05-13  Tom 7  <tom7@...>

        * Finally fixed sorting of directories in load.
        
        * Added 'impure' subdirectory to triage collection.
          Broken/joke/invalid levels go here.

        * The 'load screen' now remembers its previous position between
          loads, and behaves better with regard to modifier keys.

        * Started changelog. I only intend to record user-visible
          changes here.
